Larvae in the 5th stage may live outside of the plant particularly if the grass tillers are small, Pupation occurs in the litter layer.', 'Argentine stem weevil (Listronotus bonariensis), an exotic weevil of South American origin, is ubiquitous in agricultural and amenity turf environments throughout the country. It used to be rated New Zealand’s worst insect pest of pasture. With the successful introduction of a biocontrol agent and development of endophyte infected ryegrasses, Argentine stem weevil, although still a major pest, no longer has the impact it once had. The adults feed on a range of grasses but it is the larvae which develop and feed, predominantly, within the tillers of several agriculturally important grasses that are the main pest stage. These weevils are a major pest of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) in developed pastures, maize and cereal crops. Uncontrolled they have been estimated to cost the country up to $280m per annum. The adult weevil is a hard bodied compact beetle usually less than 3.5 mm long and 1.5 mm wide. It is grey-brown with three pale longitudinal stripes on its thorax. Its colour, small size and the fact that soil particles adhere to its body make adult weevils very difficult to detect by eye. Although it can be active during daylight, night is when it usually feeds on the leaf blades and lay its eggs. Adult weevils commence egg laying in spring as soon as temperatures allow (average daily temp 10°C). Eggs are laid in the sheaths of grass tillers. After hatching the white legless larvae tunnel and feed within tillers. Large larvae may live outside the tillers and within the plant crown especially if the tillers are small. Each larvae may destroy up to eight ryegrass tillers during development to adult and are capable of moving to new plants when required. The larvae pass through five stages of development before leaving the plants and pupating in soil. New adults commence laying eggs almost immediately after emergence from pupae giving rise to a new generation but egg laying is controlled by day-length and stops in Mid-March. The number of generations Argentine stem weevil can achieve in a year is driven by temperature. Pest status is reached when two or more generations occur as happens from Canterbury northwards. In Otago and Southland historically only one generation has generally occurred each year but anecdotal evidence suggests this has changed and stem weevil may be increasing in significance. The adult weevils can fly and mass dispersal flights can take place on calm, sunny days in summer and autumn. Host plants: Grasses, especially Italian and endophyte-free perennial ryegrasses, seedling maize and cereals, are the main hosts. Adults have been reported feeding on germinating brassica crops but may easily be mistaken for native weevils which commonly do this.', 'Adult feeding is characterised by “windowing” of the grass leaf near its tip. Windows are typically rectangular and appear as clear areas, the pane being the lower leaf cuticle which is left intact. Veins encountered while the adults feed are cut at the base and displaced. They appear as pigtail-like threads attached at the upper edge of the window. Adult feeding damage is not normally significant except in summer-sown pasture. Larvae mining the stem do the greatest damage to vegetative tillers, which wilt and yellow from the centre outwards. Damaged tillers contain larval frass and may show small, circular exit holes near the base. Flowering tillers when attacked whiten and may snap off owing to mechanical weakening. Where infestation is heavy, severe damage is done to the sward, particularly in dry conditions when pasture growth is retarded. The presence of an endophytic fungus in perennial ryegrass makes it less susceptible to Argentine stem weevil attack. Endophytes do not occur in annual ryegrasses. Other pasture grasses, cereals and maize are also affected by Argentine stem weevil. They are often reported feeding on other plants e.g. brassica seedlings. In such instances this may be driven by shortage of grasses for food or the weevils may be seeking moisture. Several species of native weevils that appear superficially similar to Argentine stem weevil are common in some pastures and crops and these are easily mistaken for Argentine stem weevil. It is quite likely that most damage to non-grass crops attributed to stem weevil is due to native weevil feeding.', 'Argentine stem weevil is difficult to control with insecticides. Several products are available that will kill adult weevils but pastures can be rapidly re-infested from others nearby. The larvae generally live within the plants on which they feed and are therefore protected from most insecticides. When establishing new pastures there are some options that can mitigate damage from this pest. Cultivation can destroy larval weevil populations and allow re-establishment of grasses into a clean pasture. This however will not protect against adults which may survive cultivation or re-invade the paddock. An insecticide can be used if necessary in this situation. Foliar sprays, prills drilled with the seed and seed coatings are available. If very high numbers of adults are present insecticide seed coating may not offer sufficient protection to avoid loss of seedlings. Even endophyte infected seedlings (see below) are vulnerable to attack while establishing. If direct-drilling is used to re-establish pastures larvae are able to survive in dying vegetation and migrate to new plants after sowing. As with all insect pests assessing the probability of damage will assist in choosing a control option. A small wasp, Microctonus hyperodae, was introduced to New Zealand in 1990 as a biological control agent and was released throughout the country. It is now well established in most areas and in combination with endophyte infected ryegrasses has reduced the impact this weevil formerly had on New Zealand pastures. This wasp is a parasite and lays its eggs inside the adult weevil. This sterilises and eventually kills the weevil. Endophyte is a term used to describe an organism that lives inside another. In this case the endophyte is a fungus called Neotyphodium lolii that lives within perennial ryegrass plants. Toxins produced by this fungus protect the plant from grazing. The “wild type” endophyte that can occur naturally in ryegrass, and used to be common in pasture cultivars, protected the plants from Argentine stem weevil but was also responsible for stock health problems such as heat stress and ryegrass staggers. Plant breeders have been able to selectively improve the fungus and ryegrass cultivars are now available with a choice of endophyte. The most prominent of these is called AR1, but NEA2 in Trojan and AR37 are also effective. These forms of the endophyte protect ryegrass from Argentine stem weevil but eliminate or reduce the effects on stock caused by the standard endophyte. When selecting perennial ryegrass cultivars for pastures, one of these endophytes should generally be used and form the backbone of Argentine stem weevil management. AR37 and NEA2 in Trojan will also protect against other insect pests.');

Pest of plantain, chicory, brassica, maize and grain crops. Will also feed on lettuce, broccoli, cabbage and silverbeet. Often found on clover but does not eat clover. The pointed shells can be up to 7 mm. Shell colour ranges from off-white to grey to pale yellow. Darker patterning, spots, or stripes may also be present.', 'Banded conical snail originated in the Mediterranean but has spread to several countries. First recorded in 1983 in New Zealand, it is now commonly found in Northland, Auckland and Waikato but only once elsewhere and that is in Poverty Bay. However, its distribution may be greater that this and is likely to expand. There appears to be two generations per year. Few snails are found in mid-summer but this may be due migration from crops and pastures to roadsides or other sheltered aestivation sites. Eggs appear to be laid in spring and again in late summer early autumn.', 'Banded conical snail appears to have a wide food range but has only been recorded damaging plantain, chicory and cabbages in New Zealand. It will feed on dead plant material, lettuce, broccoli and silver beet suggesting other field crops (brassicas and fodder beet) may also host populations. The main impact on plantain and chicory crops is noticed around October when snail numbers are high and they are feeding voraciously. Established and seedling crops are attacked. Damage appears as small “shot” holes in leaves. In Australia they have been recorded damaging cereal seedlings and in summer collect in the stalks of cereals and maize clogging machinery during harvest. It is possible that banded conical snail could be a vector for lung worm in New Zealand but this is not proven. Although it is often seen on clover, banded conical snail has not been shown to feed on clover', 'There are no established control technologies in New Zealand. In Australia trials investigating standard molluscicide baits have given variable results with the explanation that although all the standard active ingredients are toxic to the snails, banded conical snail adults are not attracted to the baits only encountering and feeding on them by chance, while immature snails don’t appear to feed on the baits. Weed control can reduce the number of snails infesting crops. Stubble management and the presence of large amounts of organic matter also have variable effects on subsequent seedling crop damage. Stubble burning reduces snail numbers markedly.');

It is at the limit of its climatic tolerance and is restricted to Waikato and Bay of Plenty northwards with a southward coastal extension into northern Taranaki and Gisborne. Black beetle outbreaks occur sporadically and follow above average spring temperatures. It has a high temperature requirement for most life processes. Female longevity, number of eggs produced, egg viability, larval survival, growth rate and the amount they eat are all favoured by temperatures greater than 20°C and are severely inhibited at between 10-15°C. Adult beetles are a characteristic glossy black and about 15 mm long with females being larger than males. They are usually found in the top 1 cm of soil. They undergo extensive dispersal flights in spring and autumn but surface air temperatures must be above 17°C for flights to occur. The eggs, about 2 mm long and ovoid to spherical in shape, are laid singly in soil, close to the surface, in spring. The creamy white C shaped larvae, usually found in the top 10 cm of soil, appear superficially like common grass-grub but are larger reaching 2.5 cm when fully grown. These fully grown larvae are present and cause damage in summer. In black beetle areas any grass-grub larvae present will be very small (less than 10 mm) at the same time of year. Black beetle larvae can also be distinguished from grass-grub by breathing pores (spiracles) that occur down the length of the body. In grass-grub these are not obvious but in black beetle they are prominent and show clearly as orange spots. Like grass-grub the larvae pass through 3 stages before pupating and emerging as adults. Pupation occurs in February/March and the beetles overwinter. These beetles will not lay eggs until the following spring.', 'The beetles and larvae of black beetle feed on several pasture grasses including annual ryegrasses, perennial ryegrasses, tall fescue, paspalum and kikuyu. Grasses with high carbohydrate levels in their roots favour adult development and ultimately the size of the populations that develop. Larval feeding is on roots often close to the surface. In severe infestations the turf can be rolled back owing to the destruction of the root system. In less severe cases the pastures can become clover dominated as legumes are not a favoured food source, or they can become open and susceptible to weed invasion. Damage to pastures from larvae can appear similar to common grass-grub but occurs over summer (January to March) as opposed to autumn/winter. The damage threshold for black beetle larvae is approximately 20-30/m2 which is considerably lower than for grass-grub. Patches of yellowing tillers that pull easily from the pasture may become noticeable in autumn and spring. This is a sign of adult feeding. Adults may feed on roots or on the base of plants at soil level. Any more than 10 adults/m2 in pasture are a concern but populations of 30/m2 have become common and they can reach as high as 95/m2. In maize 1-2 beetles/m2 in spring are sufficient to cause an economic loss. Both larvae and adults can be particularly destructive to newly sown grasses. Beetles and larvae will also feed on brassica roots, maize, sweetcorn, kumara and strawberries. A series of dry summers and autumns since 2007/8 has contributed to higher than usual numbers of black beetle particularly on light soil types. Pugging as a result of plant destruction can be a serious issue. Damage is generally more severe on dairy than on sheep and beef farms but occurs on all types.', 'There are few control options available for black beetle other than sowing resistant grasses. Ryegrasses containing the AR37 endophyte are the best option in black beetle prone areas but some protection will also be gained using Endo 5 or NEA2. Wild type (or standard endophyte) also protects from black beetle feeding. Max P in tall fescue helps protect that grass. These endophyte fungi produce toxins that deter the adult black beetles from feeding and if the beetles cannot find alternative plants to feed on they will die before they can lay their eggs. The endophytes do not directly affect the larvae. AR1 infected ryegrasses ARE NOT protected from black beetle feeding. For endophyte selection see http://www.dairynz.co.nz/page/pageid/2145866515/Pasture. Grass type can affect beetle development. Grasses with high root levels of carbohydrate enable faster beetle maturation. These include paspalum, kikuyu and several other weed grasses. Eliminating these grasses from pasture will slow development and reduce the problem. Annual ryegrasses are good host plants for black beetle. No chemicals are registered for control of larvae or adults in pasture. Imidacloprid is available as a seed coating. Sowing insecticide treated seed can provide protection against adult beeles and assist seedling establishment. It will not protect against larvae and if beetle flights are prolonged the level of protection offered may not be enough. Sowing should be delayed until late February to avoid larval attack. To maximise the benefits of pasture renovation and of the endophyte containing grasses it is important that seed is sown into clean paddocks free of other grasses that the beetles can feed on. Any pasture renewal planned for autumn should be consistent with best practice guidelines, see: http://www.dairynz.co.nz/file/fileid/34881. The use of a break crop that is unfavourable to black beetle can provide a clean seed bed and aid establishment of new pasture. Brassicas, maize, legumes and chicory do not support full development of black beetle and can be used in pasture renovation programmes.');

They have large heads with very long antennae. They have wings and although they generally do not fly there are occasional mass flights when numbers are high. Females have a long ovipositor (egg-laying tube) which extends past and under the wings. The adult males “chirp”, by rubbing their wings together. There is just one generation a year but the life stages overlap. Eggs, which are white, ovoid-shaped, and about 0.3 cm long are laid singly, but loosely clustered, about 1 cm deep in damp soil. A single female cricket is capable of laying up to 2000 eggs between mid-February and early May. After hatching the nymphs take 2-4 months to mature into adults and then live for 2-3 months. The nymphs pass through 9-10 stages and resemble small adults but do not have wings, or in the case of females, ovipositors, until the 8th and 9th stages. Overwintering occurs as eggs. The smaller nymphs live and hide within pasture and this makes them difficult to detect. Larger nymphs and adults tend to shelter in cracks in soil or under cow pats and litter. Although found throughout the North Island and milder coastal regions of the South Island they are usually only economically important in Northland, Auckland, Waikato, Bay of Plenty, Hawkes Bay, Taranaki and Manawatu. Black field crickets, especially the nymphs, are often confused with several species of much smaller native crickets. These only grow to about 1 cm and crickets larger than this are likely to be black field crickets. Native crickets are also active during the day and when disturbed will jump and be easily seen. In contrast black field crickets are active at night and if disturbed during the day will run for shelter and remain hidden. When threatened they will jump quickly away. Black field crickets can also be identified by a distinctive white band around their middle.', 'Black field crickets are generally pests only in northern areas of New Zealand. Their significance is increased in long dry periods and in soils that crack in during these periods. They feed most commonly on the leaves and germinating seeds of grasses, especially ryegrasses, but also eat legumes and weeds. Their feeding, and the type of damage they cause, can be categorised into three types: Grazing, where adults and the larger nymphs compete with stock for food. Over one hectare 2 crickets/m2 will consume the equivalent of one sheep. In plague seasons as many as 20-40 crickets/m2 frequently occur and can cause losses of 30kg DM/ha/day. In dairy pasture an average density of 25 crickets/m2 can be responsible for 2000 kg DM/ha/yr lost production. During long dry periods the growing crowns of grasses are attacked often killing the plants and leaving the soil open to weed invasion. Sown, or self sown seedlings, may be destroyed by cricket feeding. The potential for long term pasture damage and unseen losses makes early detection of crickets important. In areas prone to cricket damage the density can be quickly assessed by pouring a weak detergent solution (4 mls dishwashing liquid in 10 L water) over a known area of pasture. This will “flush” crickets out of cracks in the soil and make it easy to count them and determine their density. A density of 10/m2 is considered economically damaging.', 'Populations of more than 10 crickets/m2 are economically damaging. Control of black field crickets is usually by using grain baits coated with an insecticide (maldison).

There are several stages and forms of cabbage aphids. Adults may have wings or they may be wingless. Immature aphids have a very similar appearance to the larger adults. All stages in the life cycle are present throughout the year but vary with season. Female aphids are parthenogenic and viviparous, that is they produce live young without mating. Males rarely occur but are similar in form to the winged female. Winged aphids fly throughout the year but large numbers are produced in spring (October/November) and autumn (February/March) when the main dispersal flights occur and new infestations arise. Established aphid colonies are made up of individuals of several generations of wingless aphids which remain on the plant they started life on. A single adult produces about 25 nymphs. The rate of growth of these is dependent mainly on temperature. During summer development to reproducing adult takes 7-16 days and populations can consequently build up rapidly. In cooler winter conditions development takes up to 60 days and populations do not reach such high levels. There are at least 15 generations per year. Mature wingless adults are about 2.0mm long and 1.0mm wide, dull green to grey in colour and covered with a whitish waxy powder. There are several small black markings on the back, and at the rear of the body are two small upright projections called siphunculi. The head is small and dark with red eyes and a pair of short slender antennae. Winged adults have two pairs of strongly veined wings which, when at rest, extend well beyond the rear of the body. In contrast to the wingless form, the whitish mealy powder is virtually absent. The black markings on the back are large and clearly visible giving the winged insect a striped appearance. The immature stages (nymphs) resemble the wingless form but are much smaller being about 0.5mm at birth. They pass through four moults before becoming adults and are found together with wingless adults in colonies on plants. Cabbage aphids are found on all plants in the cruciferous family: cabbage, rape, swedes, turnips, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, kale, mustard and some weed species. It is the most common aphid found on these plants and usually the most abundant.', 'Aphids feed by sucking plant juices, causing yellowing and curling of leaves and seed heads, and wilting and stunting of plants, particularly during hot dry weather. Colonies of aphids can severely reduce the vigour and yield potential of a crop especially if it is being grown for seed production. Heavily infected forage crops such as turnips and rape may also be unpalatable to stock. Cabbage aphids transmit a number of viruses within and between brassica crops e.g. cauliflower mosaic and turnip mosaic viruses which in turn cause reductions in crop yield, and often death of plants. Symptoms of infection include crinkling and distortion of foliage and stunted plants.', 'Several insecticides are registered for use against aphids in forage brassica crops. If using a spray these should be applied as early as possible to prevent aphid build up. Consult your farm consultant, industry representative or the New Zealand Agricultural Manual for more information about chemical control. The removal of weeds (e.g. wild turnip) that act as hosts for cabbage aphid can assist in limiting damage. Populations can be affected, sometimes dramatically, by an Entomophora fungus especially during autumn and periods of high humidity. This fungus kills the aphids and leaves their mummified bodies on the plant. On close inspection these appear as “brown furry” non-responsive aphids. A parasitic wasp (Diaeretus rapae) can also kill a large number of aphids but is not usually sufficient to suppress populations. Some brassica varieties offer increased tolerance to aphid attack. Consult your farm consultant or industry representative about these.');

Bourletiella hortensi is the most common. These are soft bodied insects varying in colour from brown to black and grow up to 1 mm in length. They are a type of Collembola commonly known as globular springtails. This name derives from them appearing to consist of two attached balls (hence globular) and a specialised appendage which enables them to spring very quickly into the air (hence springtail).

Early detection or better still prediction of damage is necessary to avoid seedling loss.', 'Routine spraying or using coated seed can be worthwhile but inspection of the soil to be sown should be undertaken especially if springtails have been a problem in the past.

They are a type of Collembola commonly known as globular springtails. This name derives from them appearing to consist of 2 attached balls (hence globular) and a specialised appendage which enables them to spring very quickly into the air (hence springtail and flea). The same animal is also known as lucerne flea. Clover flea is present throughout New Zealand only reaching pest status in localised areas of the North Island – dairy pastures in parts of Northland, South Auckland, Waikato and the Bay of Plenty. After mating female clover fleas lay their eggs in batches of 2 – 40. These usually hatch after 26 – 42 days depending on temperature. Eggs laid in late spring take longer to hatch and will not do so until they have undergone periods of dry conditions followed by declining soil temperatures and increasing soil temperatures. This avoids the eggs hatching during dry summer months when food may be scarce. After hatching the young clover flea passes through 7 moults increasing in size each time until they reach a maximum size of about 3mm. Females tend to be larger than males but both are yellow green in colour with brown mottling on their backs. The adults live for approximately 15 days during which time males and females mate and egg laying starts again.', 'Clover flea is present throughout New Zealand but severe damage only occurs to dairy pastures in localised areas of the North Island – parts of Northland, South Auckland, Waikato and the Bay of Plenty. Clover flea will feed on a range of legumes but white clover is the preferred food plant in New Zealand. Damage can also be caused to lucerne, subterranean clover and when numbers are very high to grasses. Damage to clover results from young nymphs eating small holes in the leaves, giving the leaves a speckled appearance, while feeding from older nymphs and adults produces window like openings in the leaves. In cases of heavy infestation only the veins and cuticle of the clover leaf remain. Pasture damage is caused in late spring when high numbers of nymphs and adults can be present. Numbers of nymphs and adults are lower during summer, when mainly eggs are present, but increase again in autumn when again damage can occur. Pasture production losses of up to 20% frequently occur and reductions in clover yield of up to 50% have been recorded. Compounding direct feeding losses is that stock will avoid eating pasture fouled by clover flea faeces.', 'Several insecticides are registered for use against clover flea (see below) and both spray and granular formulations can be successfully used. Applications should be applied when damage is first noticed or when high numbers of clover fleas are observed. At times repeat applications may be necessary to achieve good control. In this situation the most cost effective approach can be to use diflubenzuron in conjunction with another insecticide. Registered insecticides (active ingredients) for use against clover flea in pasture or clover seed crops are: chlorpyrifos, diazinon, diflubenzuron, dimethoate, fenitrothion and maldison.

INSERT INTO `agriculture_items` VALUES (10, 'pest', 'Clover Root Weevil', 'Sitona obsoletus', 'Major pest of clovers, both red and white cultivars but white clover often most severely attacked, Found throughout New Zealand, Adults feed on clover foliage leaving distinctive notches on leaf margins, Larvae are most the damaging stage destroying clover roots and root nodules, Infested pastures become clover deficient, Biological control has significantly reduced impact of this pest.', 'Clover root weevil (CRW) adults are mahogany-brown, 4-6 mm long, with a short, blunt nose. It can be difficult to tell adult CRW apart from other weevils that can also be found in pasture. Adult weevils are most abundant in autumn and spring. They lay their eggs on the pasture surface and when these hatch the larvae move into the soil seeking food and shelter. These are legless, creamy white grubs, 1-6 mm long with a brown head. They may be found by digging into the root zone under clover plants. Larvae are present throughout the year but are more abundant in late spring and late autumn. The larvae are generally much smaller than grass-grub larvae, which can be common in pastures, and they lack the distinctive C-shape that characterise grass grub. Clover root weevil has been present in New Zealand since at least 1994 but was not discovered until 1996. By 2006 it was present throughout the North Island and by 2015 throughout the South Island. The combination of a favourable environment, lack of competition for an abundant food resource, high reproductive capability of the weevil and a lack of natural enemies inevitably meant clover root weevil was going to become one of New Zealand’s most damaging pests of clover. There are two generations a year with adult populations peaking in early and late summer in the North Island and summer and autumn in the South Island. The adults can live for several months with the females laying up to several hundred eggs. Young larvae mainly feed on clover root nodules. As they mature they move onto the roots and stolons. Adults feed on clover leaves producing characteristic notching of leaf margins. Dispersal by flight occurs during the summer and autumn with the proportion of adults having flight or reproductive capability dependent on prevailing climatic and pasture conditions. While clover is abundant and summer rainfall high or irrigation used most weevils remain reproductive and stay in the pastures they lived in as larvae. When there is drought and clover is limited a large proportion of weevils stop being reproductive and instead develop flight muscles and disperse to new locations. Once they have located a suitable site the flight muscles atrophy and the weevils again become reproductive. Clover root weevil is a very proficient hitch-hiker in hay and on vehicles.', 'Feeding by adult CRW causes distinctive semi-circular notching on the edges of clover leaves. These notches are symmetrical and uniform, unlike the jagged or irregular damage caused by other pasture pests, such as slugs and caterpillars. While this damage can appear serious, generally, it does not cause significant damage in established pastures. Adult feeding can however, kill large numbers of clover seedlings in newly sown pasture. Although adult feeding damage is most noticeable, feeding by larvae is more damaging. The young larvae feed on root nodules and later the roots. This reduces the plant’s ability to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and reduces plant growth. A reduction in nitrogen fixed also impacts on the growth of other pasture plants and leads to an increased requirement for nitrogen fertiliser to be applied. Prior to the release of the biocontrol agent moderate populations of larvae (approx. 300/m2) have reduced clover production by 35% (1000kg DM/ha) annually with greatest losses occurring in spring. Without additional nitrogen it has been estimated a typical Waikato dairy farm would suffer a 16% reduction in net profit. An extra 180 kg N/ha was required on some farms to alleviate the impact of the weevil. During invasive periods larval numbers as high as 1800/m2 have been recorded. With the establishment of biological control numbers are now usually much less. Left unchecked MPI estimated clover root weevil could have cost New Zealand between $200m and $1b per annum. A cost: benefit analysis undertaken in 2015, has shown that for Southland alone the impact of the parasitoid wasp in supressing CRW was worth $2.3m pa for beef and lamb farms and $7 M pa for dairy farms.', 'During pasture establishment application of a foliar insecticide can be used close to seedling emergence to control adults and provide a window in which clover plants may establish before re-invasion by the weevil occurs. Seed coatings do not provide adequate protection against this pest and should not be relied on. Clover root weevil is difficult to control with insecticides in established pastures. Because the larvae live in the soil and are relatively immobile, and because New Zealand soils are high in organic matter which binds up insecticide, getting an insecticide to them is difficult to achieve. The adults are very mobile and although they can be killed, pastures are rapidly reinvaded from surrounding areas. Insecticides are harmful to the biocontrol agent. Clover root weevil is dependent on clover for its survival. When pastures are severely damaged destroying the remaining clover with a selective herbicide and/or cultivation followed by a farrow period leaving the pasture clover free for 6-8 months can cause the weevil population to die off and provide a clean pasture in which clover can be re-established. Drilling clover seed into a damaged pasture without removing the older clover plants should not be attempted as the weevils prefer seedlings and will concentrate their feeding on them. Biological control will not prevent seedling damage. Establishment of clover seedlings at sowing can be improved by utilising break crops rather than straight pasture to pasture rotations. A brassica or an all grass break crop will provide a clean paddock to which clover can be re-introduced. Clover management to maintain healthy plants is important. A healthy plant can tolerate more feeding pressure than an unhealthy plant. Adequate fertiliser should be used to keep clover growing in the presence of the weevil and to keep other pasture plants, which would normally benefit from clover nitrogen fixation, healthy as well. When clover is put under pressure by clover root weevil not only do the larvae consume nodules but the plants respond to the stress by reducing nodule production. In such instances compensatory nitrogen should be applied frequently to infested pastures in small amounts. Clover should not be put under stress by other factors, do not overgraze and avoid pugging of soil over winter. In 2006 AgResearch introduced a small parasitic wasp (Microctonus aethiopoides) as a biological control agent against clover root weevil. This wasp was released at numerous locations in both islands and is now very widely distributed. This biocontrol agent will not eliminate clover root weevil or the damage it causes, but it has reduced the impact of the weevil and in most locations the impact of the weevil has been negated by the biocontrol agent. However, there will always be some years and some areas where the biocontrol agent temporarily losses effectiveness either because of climatic events, use of insecticides that kill the wasp or pasture renewal events. Biological control will re-establish.');

Many species of amaranth are cultivated as vegetables, for grain production or for animal food in warmer countries.', 'Redroot in particular is a common weed of maize, mostly because it grows as the same time as the crop, but also because it grows quickly and can form large, aggressive plants, potentially at high densities. Prostrate amaranth is also found in some maize crops but is more common on lower growing vegetable and forage crops. Redroot and other species also often establish in orchards, in the bare, sprayed strip between the crop rows. Some species of amaranth contain high levels of oxalates and, under certain conditions contain high levels of nitrate. Many poisonings of livestock in New Zealand are associated with high nitrate levels in redroot.', 'Livestock readily graze amaranth. Therefore, care is required when nitrate levels might be high. Mowing plants taller than the crop, or where no desirable plants are present will give some control and may reduce seed production. In cropping cultivation can be used to gain control, but these species tend to emerge at the same time as maize crops. Stale seed bed methods can be effective for later sown crops. Redroot and other amaranth species are susceptible to most herbicides that do not affect the crop. In maize atrazine, acetochlor, mesotrione, nicosulfuron and topramezone are often used. In orchards or waste spaces glyphosate or glufosinate can both give good control. If using chlorsulfuron in cereals, amaranth seedlings should be treated when small.

Annual grass that mostly germinates in autumn and sets seed in summer. Germination can occur in spring and plants then produce seed late in a shortened growing season. Seeds have little dormancy and most germinate in the autumn following their production. A few can last longer if trapped under dry cow-pats or tree branches. Six species of barley grass are present in New Zealand: Critesion glaucum, C. hystrix, C. jubatum, C. marinum, C. murinum and C. secalinum. Differences between the six species are small and they can all be managed in the same way (i.e. same control methods). Barley grass (Critesion murinum) is the most common and inhabits disturbed areas (e.g. stock camps) in pastures, and sometimes in crops. Barley grass is divided into two subspecies murinum and subspecies leporinum: the latter tends to occur in drier areas. Squirrel tail grass (C. jubatum) has long soft awns (which may have a pink tinge) and is only found in damp salt pans in Central Otago. Salt barley grass (C. marinum) and Mediterranean barley grass (C. hystrix) mostly grow on salt-affected pastures, salty marshes, and coastal areas. C. secalinum is a perennial grass, unlike the other five, which are annuals, and is only found near Porangahau in coastal Hawkes Bay. Provides good-quality feed in autumn and during winter when plants are in the vegetative stage. Used for cover-cropping in Europe, in olive groves to prevent erosion in mountainous areas in Spain, and in vineyards in Turkey. An additional benefit is that barley grass tolerates drought well.', 'Predominately a weed of high fertility soils, although salt barley grass and Mediterranean barley grass are prevalent on low fertility soils. Compete more strongly in pastures in nitrogen-enriched soils. Prevalent on stock camps, along fence lines and shelter belts and other disturbed or high usage areas where pasture cover is damaged in late summer and early autumn. Provides low quality forage during late spring as the plants begin to flower. Sheep avoid grazing barley grass when the seed heads emerge. Avoidance of barley grass places more pressure on better pasture species. Barley grass can tolerate conditions of water stress better than other species and being an annual, avoids summer drought. Perennial grasses on the other hand, will be selectively grazed over summer. Grazing pressure, in combination with water stress, can lead to the decline of perennial species in pastures and reduce their ability to compete against annual grass weeds, such as barley grass. This enables undesirable annual species to gain a stronger foothold over time. Sharp, awned seeds can penetrate fleeces, pelts, carcasses, hocks, mouths and eyes of grazing livestock. If seed contamination is severe, stock growth rates can be reduced. Fine wool sheep tend to pick up the seeds more easily than sheep with coarse wool, although the actual skin damage is less in sheep with fine wool. Lambs are much more susceptible than older sheep, as their skin is more easily penetrated. They spend more time lying on the ground, which increases the chance of them picking up barley grass seed. Sheep dogs sometimes pick up barley grass seeds between their toes, leading to sores and lameness.', 'As with most grass weeds, an integrated approach is important with a focus on maintaining a healthy cover of desirable, competitive pasture species – especially in late summer and autumn. Tools for this include grazing management, fertiliser, herbicide and physical removal of plants. Seeds have very little dormancy and do not survive for long in the soil; so that grazing management to prevent seed production can control barley grass within a few years. Summer: Identify areas of barley grass infestation from their seed heads and mark the areas on your farm map. Decide on the best method of control for the area depending on access to boom-spray, ease of controlled grazing, potential damage to pelts. (Is the area used for grazing lambs?) Lax grazing during summer helps maintain pasture cover and can reduce barley grass establishment in autumn. Autumn: Heavy grazing may be required in paddocks to be treated with herbicides (pastures must be short for some herbicides to work effectively). Removal of standing pasture will also increase access for boom-sprays and other equipment. Winter: Rest infested paddocks from grazing if possible. In response, barley grass produces plants with fewer tillers which have their growing points higher from the ground. Spring: Graze more heavily. Stock removes the growing point; the tiller dies and no seed is produced. Grazing pressure must be maintained to prevent new tillers and seed heads from being formed, or at least to reduce the height of the barley grass seed heads. This reduces the damage that seeds cause to sheep. Some pasture species and cultivars are more resistant to barley grass than others, often because they withstand summer drought better. Novel endophytes can help pastures resist weed invasion and spread. Endophytes can allow pasture species to be more drought tolerant and resistant to insect attack. This enables sown pasture species to grow more vigorously, making it more difficult for weeds to establish. Some high endophyte ryegrass cultivars and low-growing cultivars of cocksfoot seem to be more effective. Ensure soil fertility levels are appropriate as this can increase the vigour of sown pasture species and reduce barley grass establishment. Note that barley grass is often found on high fertility, disturbed areas such as stock camps, along fence lines, around gate ways and watering points. In these areas, it is difficult for competitive pasture species to establish and suppress barley grass. Clippings should be collected and dumped securely to prevent the seeds from ripening. Small numbers of plants can be grubbed or manually removed. Winter-cleaning: herbicides can be applied during vegetative stage at levels sufficient to selectively kill barley grass plants. Spraying barley grass in summer with glyphosate damages pasture species and creates a perfect seed bed for germination of surviving seeds. Herbicides used to control barley grass in pastures include the following: paraquat or glyphosate + simazine (At the green seed head stage, Yes, Yes, Severe, Severe), dalapon (Late autumn to early spring during vegetative growth, Moderate, Slight, No), dalapon + TCA (Late autumn to early spring during vegetative growth, Yes, Slight, No), ethofumesate (Mid-autumn until mid-winter, during vegetative growth, Yes, Not to ryegrass, Severe), propyzamide (Winter during vegetative growth, Yes, Severe, No). Effectiveness of herbicides depends on: Application rate, Soil moisture conditions and plant stress, Pasture height and size of plants being sprayed. As glyphosate will kill all plants it contacts, patches of bare ground (gaps) are created, this, neither glyphosate nor paraquat are recommended for barley grass control. Simazine can be added to glyphosate or paraquat to provide residual control of barley grass (simazine is residual in the soil and prevents seeds from germinating). Ethofumesate can be applied to ryegrass pastures (ryegrass is tolerant to ethofumesate), but ethofumesate kills clovers. Consult your farm consultant, industry rep or the New Zealand Agrichemical Manual for more information about chemical control. Suggestion based on size of infestation: Small patches: Remove manually or apply herbicide. Note that applying herbicide once flowering has started may allow seeds to form and patches to grow in successive years. 50% paddock cover: Apply herbicide. Graze laxly over summer and early autumn so that sown pasture species are not overgrazed. This enables sown species to grow vigorously after autumn rains and suppress barley grass. Keep lambs off affected paddocks. Most of paddock covered: Consider resowing, using recommended species of grasses with appropriate endophytes for the region.');

Plants can grow and flower in photoperiods of 8 to 16 hours, but perform better in long day photoperiods.

Barnyards grass has occasionally been grown as a grain and in some circumstances it can provide fodder for livestock. However it is not a reliable source of fodder.', 'Barnyard grass is rarely a problem in pasture because its seeds cannot germinate in the shade of other plants and it germinates when pasture species are growing quickly.

It is a major weed of rice, and is known to reduce yields in maize and other crops.', 'Cultivation or mowing before plants set seed can give useful control in some situations. Crop rotation can be a useful tool for limiting the build-up of weeds. Continuous cropping with the same crop builds up weeds that match the growth patterns of the crop. This should be avoided if at all possible by alternating maize, for example, with non-grass crops. Weeds in maize are usually controlled with a mixture of pre-emergence herbicides The most common combination used in New Zealand is a mixture of a triazine, such as atrazine or terbuthylazine for broadleaf control, and a chloroacetamide like alachlor, metolachlor or acetochlor for the control of grass weeds. Pre-emergence herbicides must be activated either by mechanical incorporation or by rainfall before it can be taken up by emerging weed seedlings. As the crop grows it is important to monitor for weeds that have emerged despite the pre-emergent herbicide, so that post-emergent herbicides like nicosulfuron, mesotrione or topramezone can be applied early enough to be effective.');

Young plants are mildly poisonous to stock, older plants have vicious spines, and produce burs that contaminate wool and socks, and can cause dermatitis in some people. Benefits? Absolutely none!', 'Bathurst bur is mainly a pasture weed but it is also a weed of summer growing crops. Contamination of pastures and stock can reduce agricultural productivity. A single bur in a pack of wool can lead to rejection or down grading the entire consignment. Burrs are easily spread from one place to another and once populations are established plants will repeatedly re-appear from buried seeds. Plants can out-compete and replace desirable grasses and clovers, and the spines discourage stock from grazing close to desirable plants leading to poor pasture utilisation. Burrs become entangled in wool, leading to its downgrading as they are difficult to remove. Burrs also damage the feet of sheep and other stock when they walk through dense patches.', 'Be careful not to import hay from farms where the weed is prevalent, and ensure contractors don’t bring it onto your farm from contaminated properties. Uncertified seed in summer crops such as maize, sorghum and sunflowers can also contain burs. Removing the first few plants that appear on the farm can pay big dividends by saving on future costs. Pulling plants out (carefully – watch those spines!) and putting them in plastic bags before burning or burying them very deeply is probably the best treatment for those first few. Take care not to spread the seed around. After using herbicides, competitive pastures must be maintained to reduce re-infestation. Grazing is not an effective method of control. Mowing is not usually an effective control method. Rotary slashing can be used but must be done before any burs are formed, and plants may still regrow afterwards. The best long term control option is probably pasture renewal, with a summer of fodder cropping. A large proportion of the dormant seed will then germinate and allow easier control. Establishment of more competitive and locally-appropriate pasture species may reduce the incidence of Bathurst bur by shading it out. A dense sward of sown pasture species, especially in late spring but preferably all year round, prevents plants from establishing. Control programmes should aim to prevent seeding for 3 or 4 years. In pasture young plants can be controlled with broadcast applications of 2,4-D or MCPA, preferably before any burs are produced. Metribuzin, picloram, dicamba, 2,4-DB, MCPB, atrazine and pendimethalin have all been used selectively in the appropriate crops, refer to specific product labels and cropping guides for their use. Mature plants in pasture will require spot treatment with herbicides which will damage either the grass or the clover (or in some cases both) component of the pasture sward, refer to table below for options. One recommendation is to spray before plants set seed with metsulfuron + penetrant, clopyralid or glyphosate. All of these will damage clovers: clopyralid does NOT damage grasses and will not result in bare ground but both have residual activity. Metsulfuron kills some species of grasses, but not all, and it again has residual activity. Glyphosate kills any green plants and results in bare ground in which new seedlings of Bathurst bur can emerge, but it has no residual activity. Clopyralid can contaminate lawn clippings and and these must NOT be composted. It is recommended that with the exception of 2,4-D all the chemicals below only be used as spot treatments in pasture. They may be used over larger waste areas. No biological control agents are available for Bathurst bur. A fungus (Colletotrichum orbiculare) that causes anthracnose and seedling blight in Bathurst bur was observed in New South Wales in 1948 and was tested as a control agent, but did not prove reliable enough to be of practical use. Other insects and fungi attack Bathurst bur but outbreaks are spasmodic and none have given long-term control.');

One plant can produce up to 5000 seeds that can germinate immediately. However, if the seeds are in environments that do not favour germination they can survive for several years. Seeds are small and sticky when wet so can stick to footwear, enabling them be transported and dispersed.

Seeds generally do not germinate in the presence of competitive or shading vegetation such as pasture. Plants can act as hosts for common garden pests such as aphids. Wavy bitter cress is more abundant in Poverty Bay and has been noted as a weed of arable crops in that region. Bitter cress is rarely a pasture weed although it could interfere with establishment of a new pasture if present in high numbers. Young stems with their soft, finely-divided leaves break easily but later become tougher and can sprawl for long distances.', 'Hand weeding is very effective but must be repeated regularly, preferably before the plants set seed. Individual plants are easy to dislodge and uproot. Uprooted fruiting plants can continue shedding seed. Bitter cress is usually found in open places and the seeds probably don’t germinate under the cover of vegetation. Bitter cress also germinates from very close to the surface (less than 10 mm deep) and will not grow if the soil surface is dry. It germinates best in compacted, damp soils. Bitter cress (Cardamine hirsuta) is readily controlled by a wide range of herbicides including 2,4-D, glyphosate and many of those normally used in crop production.');

Margins are entire or shallowly lobed, sometimes coarsely toothed, narrowing to the leaf stalk, Flowers are white or pale mauve, up to 13 mm in diameter, with five pointed petals and a central column of fused yellow anthers. Five- to 10-flowered umbel-like inflorescences are carried on stalks up to 25 mm long. Plants flower from October through to May, Fruits are round berries about 7-10 mm in diameter, initially green to yellowish but turning glossy black when ripe. Occasionally plants have ripe berries that are green to pale yellow, Black nightshade is often confused with, and sometimes called ‘deadly nightshade’. However, deadly nightshade (Atropa bella-donna) is very rare in New Zealand. Black nightshade is the plant most often referred to New Zealand’s National Poisons Information Centre. It states “Black nightshade is not highly toxic and small accidental ingestions of a few berries or leaves rarely leads to symptoms. Toxicity would only be expected following ingestion of large amounts of unripe berries or other plant matter.” However, children should be advised not to eat the green unripe berries which are more poisonous than ripe black ones.', 'Originally from Europe and Asia, black nightshade has been introduced to many other countries and has thrived. In New Zealand it was first recorded in 1853. Plants are very variable in size and can produce as many as 168,000 seeds per plant or as few as 600. Each berry contains an average of about 60 seeds. Little or no dormancy appears to be present in the seeds after they are separated from the berries. However, seed buried in the soil can remain dormant for many years. Seeds are distributed in contaminated crops or vegetable matter, and also by birds and rodents that eat the berries. Seeds can germinate over long periods in late spring and summer. Apparently alternating temperatures promote germination, and exposure to light can also play a role. Stratification (storage of moist seed at low temperature) can also stimulate later germination. Plants growing at favourable times of the year can flower within 5 to 6 weeks. Plants are killed by frosts, so late-germinating plants may be killed before they can set seed. Both the leaves and fruits have been used as food in some countries. Note that only fully ripe fruit should be used as under-ripe berries may be toxic. Now abundant throughout the North and South Islands, as well as on the Kermadecs, Stewart and Chatham Islands. Commonly found in open places, especially on arable land, in waste places, dry river beds and roadsides. Especially common in frequently disturbed areas.', 'Black nightshade can grow quickly in summer and can be a serious competitor in some crops, Seeds, especially when green (and therefore more toxic), can sometimes contaminate crops such as peas, Can harbour insects and diseases that affect crops.', 'Hand weeding is effective but needs to be repeated, preferably before the plants set seed. Individual plants can be pulled out readily when young but become much harder to dislodge after branching starts. In many cases, Solanum nigrum is readily controlled by cultivation and by most herbicides. However it is resistant to some sulphonylurea herbicides, including chlorsulfuron (e.g. Glean), commonly used in cereal crops, and to metsulfuron-methyl (e.g. Escort), used for general weed control. In these cases a second herbicide needs to be added. Black nightshade is not killed by trifluralin so other herbicides must be used. If triazine herbicides like simazine are regularly used in situations such as orchards, then black nightshade can develop resistance to such herbicides. If such resistance does develop, black nightshade can be killed in peas with herbicides like MCPB and bentazone, or in maize, dicamba is effective.');

Pteridium esculentum is also found in Australia and the Society Islands but Pteridium aquilinum, a very close relative, is widespread throughout the world. Pteridium esculentum rapidly increased in area in New Zealand as early humans cleared and burned forests and it is now common throughout the country in open habitats. Bracken is a fern, reproducing by spores that germinate to produce a small prothallus This develops male and female sexual organs that in turn produce male and female gametes, resulting in the formation of a new fern plant. Bracken spores are very small and are released between late summer and autumn They can be carried for considerable distances on air currents. Bracken rhizomes were used by Maori as a starchy food, Dry bracken stalks have multiple uses as play things, from arrows to kite structures.', 'Tall-growing bracken can make stock access and mustering very difficult, Bracken, like ring fern, can form very dense cover, smothering useful pasture species, Bracken uses valuable soil nutrients for growth and these nutrients are locked up in the fronds until they eventually break down. Some strains of bracken appear to be more toxic than others, but all can be poisonous to livestock if large quantities are eaten, Bracken contains carcinogens that can cause cancerous lesions in livestock. Bracken competes strongly with young trees and is also a fire risk.', 'Bracken is rhizomatous and difficult to kill, Bracken commonly grows in poorer grazing land, therefore, its control may not be economically feasible. Grazing is not an effective method of control, but heavy treading by cattle can be used to crush the new fern shoots as they are emerging. Repeated mowing or crushing can be used as control measures. However, where bracken grows on steep hillsides this may not be practical. Establishment of new competitive pasture species, suited to local conditions, can be used after initial clearance of fern, and may, if adequately limed and fertilised, help to prevent reestablishment. Trees can form a dense canopy and shade out bracken but the trees must be protected from bracken when young. Bracken is generally very difficult to kill with herbicides, though it is susceptible to glyphosate and high rates of metsulfuron, both of which are damaging to grasses. Two selective herbicides – asulam and primisulfuron will control bracken within pine forests. Asulam should be applied without surfactant when releasing young trees. Asulam (Asulox) is selective in pastures and should be applied when bracken fronds are fully expanded but before they are affected by frost (late summer to early autumn). Its effect on the bracken will not be obvious until the following spring. No biological control agents are available for either species.');

The adults feed on a range of grasses but it is the larvae which develop and feed, predominantly, within the tillers of several agriculturally important grasses that are the main pest stage. These weevils are a major pest of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) in developed pastures, maize and cereal crops. Uncontrolled they have been estimated to cost the country up to $280m per annum. The adult weevil is a hard bodied compact beetle usually less than 3.5 mm long and 1.5 mm wide. It is grey-brown with three pale longitudinal stripes on its thorax. Its colour, small size and the fact that soil particles adhere to its body make adult weevils very difficult to detect by eye. Although it can be active during daylight, night is when it usually feeds on the leaf blades and lay its eggs. Adult weevils commence egg laying in spring as soon as temperatures allow (average daily temp 10°C). Eggs are laid in the sheaths of grass tillers. After hatching the white legless larvae tunnel and feed within tillers. Large larvae may live outside the tillers and within the plant crown especially if the tillers are small. Each larvae may destroy up to eight ryegrass tillers during development to adult and are capable of moving to new plants when required. The larvae pass through five stages of development before leaving the plants and pupating in soil. New adults commence laying eggs almost immediately after emergence from pupae giving rise to a new generation but egg laying is controlled by day-length and stops in Mid-March.

It will feed on dead plant material, lettuce, broccoli and silver beet suggesting other field crops (brassicas and fodder beet) may also host populations. The main impact on plantain and chicory crops is noticed around October when snail numbers are high and they are feeding voraciously. Established and seedling crops are attacked. Damage appears as small “shot” holes in leaves. In Australia they have been recorded damaging cereal seedlings and in summer collect in the stalks of cereals and maize clogging machinery during harvest. It is possible that banded conical snail could be a vector for lung worm in New Zealand but this is not proven. Although it is often seen on clover, banded conical snail has not been shown to feed on clover', 'There are no established control technologies in New Zealand. In Australia trials investigating standard molluscicide baits have given variable results with the explanation that although all the standard active ingredients are toxic to the snails, banded conical snail adults are not attracted to the baits only encountering and feeding on them by chance, while immature snails don’t appear to feed on the baits. Weed control can reduce the number of snails infesting crops. Stubble management and the presence of large amounts of organic matter also have variable effects on subsequent seedling crop damage. Stubble burning reduces snail numbers markedly.');

They have large heads with very long antennae. They have wings and although they generally do not fly there are occasional mass flights when numbers are high. Females have a long ovipositor (egg-laying tube) which extends past and under the wings. The adult males “chirp”, by rubbing their wings together. There is just one generation a year but the life stages overlap. Eggs, which are white, ovoid-shaped, and about 0.3 cm long are laid singly, but loosely clustered, about 1 cm deep in damp soil. A single female cricket is capable of laying up to 2000 eggs between mid-February and early May. After hatching the nymphs take 2-4 months to mature into adults and then live for 2-3 months. The nymphs pass through 9-10 stages and resemble small adults but do not have wings, or in the case of females, ovipositors, until the 8th and 9th stages. Overwintering occurs as eggs. The smaller nymphs live and hide within pasture and this makes them difficult to detect. Larger nymphs and adults tend to shelter in cracks in soil or under cow pats and litter. Although found throughout the North Island and milder coastal regions of the South Island they are usually only economically important in Northland, Auckland, Waikato, Bay of Plenty, Hawkes Bay, Taranaki and Manawatu. Black field crickets, especially the nymphs, are often confused with several species of much smaller native crickets. These only grow to about 1 cm and crickets larger than this are likely to be black field crickets. Native crickets are also active during the day and when disturbed will jump and be easily seen. In contrast black field crickets are active at night and if disturbed during the day will run for shelter and remain hidden. When threatened they will jump quickly away. Black field crickets can also be identified by a distinctive white band around their middle.', 'Black field crickets are generally pests only in northern areas of New Zealand. Their significance is increased in long dry periods and in soils that crack in during these periods. They feed most commonly on the leaves and germinating seeds of grasses, especially ryegrasses, but also eat legumes and weeds. Their feeding, and the type of damage they cause, can be categorised into three types: Grazing, where adults and the larger nymphs compete with stock for food. Over one hectare 2 crickets/m2 will consume the equivalent of one sheep. In plague seasons as many as 20-40 crickets/m2 frequently occur and can cause losses of 30kg DM/ha/day. In dairy pasture an average density of 25 crickets/m2 can be responsible for 2000 kg DM/ha/yr lost production. During long dry periods the growing crowns of grasses are attacked often killing the plants and leaving the soil open to weed invasion. Sown, or self sown seedlings, may be destroyed by cricket feeding. The potential for long term pasture damage and unseen losses makes early detection of crickets important. In areas prone to cricket damage the density can be quickly assessed by pouring a weak detergent solution (4 mls dishwashing liquid in 10 L water) over a known area of pasture. This will “flush” crickets out of cracks in the soil and make it easy to count them and determine their density. A density of 10/m2 is considered economically damaging.', 'Populations of more than 10 crickets/m2 are economically damaging. Control of black field crickets is usually by using grain baits coated with an insecticide (maldison).

There are several stages and forms of cabbage aphids. Adults may have wings or they may be wingless. Immature aphids have a very similar appearance to the larger adults. All stages in the life cycle are present throughout the year but vary with season. Female aphids are parthenogenic and viviparous, that is they produce live young without mating. Males rarely occur but are similar in form to the winged female. Winged aphids fly throughout the year but large numbers are produced in spring (October/November) and autumn (February/March) when the main dispersal flights occur and new infestations arise. Established aphid colonies are made up of individuals of several generations of wingless aphids which remain on the plant they started life on. A single adult produces about 25 nymphs. The rate of growth of these is dependent mainly on temperature. During summer development to reproducing adult takes 7-16 days and populations can consequently build up rapidly. In cooler winter conditions development takes up to 60 days and populations do not reach such high levels. There are at least 15 generations per year. Mature wingless adults are about 2.0mm long and 1.0mm wide, dull green to grey in colour and covered with a whitish waxy powder. There are several small black markings on the back, and at the rear of the body are two small upright projections called siphunculi. The head is small and dark with red eyes and a pair of short slender antennae. Winged adults have two pairs of strongly veined wings which, when at rest, extend well beyond the rear of the body. In contrast to the wingless form, the whitish mealy powder is virtually absent. The black markings on the back are large and clearly visible giving the winged insect a striped appearance. The immature stages (nymphs) resemble the wingless form but are much smaller being about 0.5mm at birth. They pass through four moults before becoming adults and are found together with wingless adults in colonies on plants. Cabbage aphids are found on all plants in the cruciferous family: cabbage, rape, swedes, turnips, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, kale, mustard and some weed species. It is the most common aphid found on these plants and usually the most abundant.', 'Aphids feed by sucking plant juices, causing yellowing and curling of leaves and seed heads, and wilting and stunting of plants, particularly during hot dry weather. Colonies of aphids can severely reduce the vigour and yield potential of a crop especially if it is being grown for seed production. Heavily infected forage crops such as turnips and rape may also be unpalatable to stock. Cabbage aphids transmit a number of viruses within and between brassica crops e.g. cauliflower mosaic and turnip mosaic viruses which in turn cause reductions in crop yield, and often death of plants. Symptoms of infection include crinkling and distortion of foliage and stunted plants.', 'Several insecticides are registered for use against aphids in forage brassica crops. If using a spray these should be applied as early as possible to prevent aphid build up. Consult your farm consultant, industry representative or the New Zealand Agricultural Manual for more information about chemical control. The removal of weeds (e.g. wild turnip) that act as hosts for cabbage aphid can assist in limiting damage. Populations can be affected, sometimes dramatically, by an Entomophora fungus especially during autumn and periods of high humidity. This fungus kills the aphids and leaves their mummified bodies on the plant. On close inspection these appear as “brown furry” non-responsive aphids. A parasitic wasp (Diaeretus rapae) can also kill a large number of aphids but is not usually sufficient to suppress populations. Some brassica varieties offer increased tolerance to aphid attack.

Bourletiella hortensi is the most common. These are soft bodied insects varying in colour from brown to black and grow up to 1 mm in length. They are a type of Collembola commonly known as globular springtails. This name derives from them appearing to consist of two attached balls (hence globular) and a specialised appendage which enables them to spring very quickly into the air (hence springtail).

Early detection or better still prediction of damage is necessary to avoid seedling loss.', 'Routine spraying or using coated seed can be worthwhile but inspection of the soil to be sown should be undertaken especially if springtails have been a problem in the past.

This name derives from them appearing to consist of 2 attached balls (hence globular) and a specialised appendage which enables them to spring very quickly into the air (hence springtail and flea). The same animal is also known as lucerne flea. Clover flea is present throughout New Zealand only reaching pest status in localised areas of the North Island – dairy pastures in parts of Northland, South Auckland, Waikato and the Bay of Plenty. After mating female clover fleas lay their eggs in batches of 2 – 40. These usually hatch after 26 – 42 days depending on temperature. Eggs laid in late spring take longer to hatch and will not do so until they have undergone periods of dry conditions followed by declining soil temperatures and increasing soil temperatures. This avoids the eggs hatching during dry summer months when food may be scarce. After hatching the young clover flea passes through 7 moults increasing in size each time until they reach a maximum size of about 3mm. Females tend to be larger than males but both are yellow green in colour with brown mottling on their backs. The adults live for approximately 15 days during which time males and females mate and egg laying starts again.', 'Clover flea is present throughout New Zealand but severe damage only occurs to dairy pastures in localised areas of the North Island – parts of Northland, South Auckland, Waikato and the Bay of Plenty. Clover flea will feed on a range of legumes but white clover is the preferred food plant in New Zealand. Damage can also be caused to lucerne, subterranean clover and when numbers are very high to grasses. Damage to clover results from young nymphs eating small holes in the leaves, giving the leaves a speckled appearance, while feeding from older nymphs and adults produces window like openings in the leaves. In cases of heavy infestation only the veins and cuticle of the clover leaf remain. Pasture damage is caused in late spring when high numbers of nymphs and adults can be present. Numbers of nymphs and adults are lower during summer, when mainly eggs are present, but increase again in autumn when again damage can occur. Pasture production losses of up to 20% frequently occur and reductions in clover yield of up to 50% have been recorded. Compounding direct feeding losses is that stock will avoid eating pasture fouled by clover flea faeces.', 'Several insecticides are registered for use against clover flea (see below) and both spray and granular formulations can be successfully used. Applications should be applied when damage is first noticed or when high numbers of clover fleas are observed. At times repeat applications may be necessary to achieve good control. In this situation the most cost effective approach can be to use diflubenzuron in conjunction with another insecticide. Registered insecticides (active ingredients) for use against clover flea in pasture or clover seed crops are: chlorpyrifos, diazinon, diflubenzuron, dimethoate, fenitrothion and maldison.

INSERT INTO `agriculture_items` VALUES (30, 'pest', 'Clover Root Weevil', 'Sitona obsoletus', 'Major pest of clovers, both red and white cultivars but white clover often most severely attacked, Found throughout New Zealand, Adults feed on clover foliage leaving distinctive notches on leaf margins, Larvae are most the damaging stage destroying clover roots and root nodules, Infested pastures become clover deficient, Biological control has significantly reduced impact of this pest.', 'Clover root weevil (CRW) adults are mahogany-brown, 4-6 mm long, with a short, blunt nose. It can be difficult to tell adult CRW apart from other weevils that can also be found in pasture. Adult weevils are most abundant in autumn and spring. They lay their eggs on the pasture surface and when these hatch the larvae move into the soil seeking food and shelter. These are legless, creamy white grubs, 1-6 mm long with a brown head. They may be found by digging into the root zone under clover plants. Larvae are present throughout the year but are more abundant in late spring and late autumn. The larvae are generally much smaller than grass-grub larvae, which can be common in pastures, and they lack the distinctive C-shape that characterise grass grub. Clover root weevil has been present in New Zealand since at least 1994 but was not discovered until 1996. By 2006 it was present throughout the North Island and by 2015 throughout the South Island. The combination of a favourable environment, lack of competition for an abundant food resource, high reproductive capability of the weevil and a lack of natural enemies inevitably meant clover root weevil was going to become one of New Zealand’s most damaging pests of clover. There are two generations a year with adult populations peaking in early and late summer in the North Island and summer and autumn in the South Island. The adults can live for several months with the females laying up to several hundred eggs. Young larvae mainly feed on clover root nodules. As they mature they move onto the roots and stolons. Adults feed on clover leaves producing characteristic notching of leaf margins. Dispersal by flight occurs during the summer and autumn with the proportion of adults having flight or reproductive capability dependent on prevailing climatic and pasture conditions. While clover is abundant and summer rainfall high or irrigation used most weevils remain reproductive and stay in the pastures they lived in as larvae. When there is drought and clover is limited a large proportion of weevils stop being reproductive and instead develop flight muscles and disperse to new locations. Once they have located a suitable site the flight muscles atrophy and the weevils again become reproductive. Clover root weevil is a very proficient hitch-hiker in hay and on vehicles.', 'Feeding by adult CRW causes distinctive semi-circular notching on the edges of clover leaves. These notches are symmetrical and uniform, unlike the jagged or irregular damage caused by other pasture pests, such as slugs and caterpillars. While this damage can appear serious, generally, it does not cause significant damage in established pastures. Adult feeding can however, kill large numbers of clover seedlings in newly sown pasture. Although adult feeding damage is most noticeable, feeding by larvae is more damaging. The young larvae feed on root nodules and later the roots. This reduces the plant’s ability to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and reduces plant growth. A reduction in nitrogen fixed also impacts on the growth of other pasture plants and leads to an increased requirement for nitrogen fertiliser to be applied. Prior to the release of the biocontrol agent moderate populations of larvae (approx. 300/m2) have reduced clover production by 35% (1000kg DM/ha) annually with greatest losses occurring in spring. Without additional nitrogen it has been estimated a typical Waikato dairy farm would suffer a 16% reduction in net profit. An extra 180 kg N/ha was required on some farms to alleviate the impact of the weevil. During invasive periods larval numbers as high as 1800/m2 have been recorded. With the establishment of biological control numbers are now usually much less. Left unchecked MPI estimated clover root weevil could have cost New Zealand between $200m and $1b per annum. A cost: benefit analysis undertaken in 2015, has shown that for Southland alone the impact of the parasitoid wasp in supressing CRW was worth $2.3m pa for beef and lamb farms and $7 M pa for dairy farms.', 'During pasture establishment application of a foliar insecticide can be used close to seedling emergence to control adults and provide a window in which clover plants may establish before re-invasion by the weevil occurs. Seed coatings do not provide adequate protection against this pest and should not be relied on. Clover root weevil is difficult to control with insecticides in established pastures. Because the larvae live in the soil and are relatively immobile, and because New Zealand soils are high in organic matter which binds up insecticide, getting an insecticide to them is difficult to achieve. The adults are very mobile and although they can be killed, pastures are rapidly reinvaded from surrounding areas. Insecticides are harmful to the biocontrol agent. Clover root weevil is dependent on clover for its survival. When pastures are severely damaged destroying the remaining clover with a selective herbicide and/or cultivation followed by a farrow period leaving the pasture clover free for 6-8 months can cause the weevil population to die off and provide a clean pasture in which clover can be re-established. Drilling clover seed into a damaged pasture without removing the older clover plants should not be attempted as the weevils prefer seedlings and will concentrate their feeding on them. Biological control will not prevent seedling damage. Establishment of clover seedlings at sowing can be improved by utilising break crops rather than straight pasture to pasture rotations. A brassica or an all grass break crop will provide a clean paddock to which clover can be re-introduced. Clover management to maintain healthy plants is important. A healthy plant can tolerate more feeding pressure than an unhealthy plant. Adequate fertiliser should be used to keep clover growing in the presence of the weevil and to keep other pasture plants, which would normally benefit from clover nitrogen fixation, healthy as well. When clover is put under pressure by clover root weevil not only do the larvae consume nodules but the plants respond to the stress by reducing nodule production. In such instances compensatory nitrogen should be applied frequently to infested pastures in small amounts. Clover should not be put under stress by other factors, do not overgraze and avoid pugging of soil over winter. In 2006 AgResearch introduced a small parasitic wasp (Microctonus aethiopoides) as a biological control agent against clover root weevil. This wasp was released at numerous locations in both islands and is now very widely distributed. This biocontrol agent will not eliminate clover root weevil or the damage it causes, but it has reduced the impact of the weevil and in most locations the impact of the weevil has been negated by the biocontrol agent. However, there will always be some years and some areas where the biocontrol agent temporarily losses effectiveness either because of climatic events, use of insecticides that kill the wasp or pasture renewal events. Biological control will re-establish.');

Some are also serious weeds of summer crops, notably maize, Originating from warm countries, amaranths tend to germinate in late spring, grow and flower in the summer. Almost all of the species found here are annual species and die after flowering or with the first frosts, Amaranths are C4 plants, meaning that their photosynthesis pathways produce 4-carbon sugars rather than 3-carbon sugars. They can tolerate warmer and drier conditions than our winter-growing species.', 'All the species of Amaranthus originated in tropical and subtropical countries, some in North and Central America, some in Europe and Asia.

Most of the species found in New Zealand are annuals but one or two species can persist as short-lived perennials, especially in frost-free places. Being from the tropics or subtropics all species are sensitive to and killed by frosts. Some species are used as ornamental garden plants and some are grown for their grain production. Many species of amaranth are cultivated as vegetables, for grain production or for animal food in warmer countries.', 'Redroot in particular is a common weed of maize, mostly because it grows as the same time as the crop, but also because it grows quickly and can form large, aggressive plants, potentially at high densities. Prostrate amaranth is also found in some maize crops but is more common on lower growing vegetable and forage crops. Redroot and other species also often establish in orchards, in the bare, sprayed strip between the crop rows. Some species of amaranth contain high levels of oxalates and, under certain conditions contain high levels of nitrate. Many poisonings of livestock in New Zealand are associated with high nitrate levels in redroot.', 'Livestock readily graze amaranth. Therefore, care is required when nitrate levels might be high. Mowing plants taller than the crop, or where no desirable plants are present will give some control and may reduce seed production. In cropping cultivation can be used to gain control, but these species tend to emerge at the same time as maize crops. Stale seed bed methods can be effective for later sown crops. Redroot and other amaranth species are susceptible to most herbicides that do not affect the crop. In maize atrazine, acetochlor, mesotrione, nicosulfuron and topramezone are often used. In orchards or waste spaces glyphosate or glufosinate can both give good control. If using chlorsulfuron in cereals, amaranth seedlings should be treated when small. Trifluralin, applied and incorporated before the crop is sown, is effective. Some commonly used herbicides like clopyralid or ioxynil will not control these species.');

Annual grass that mostly germinates in autumn and sets seed in summer. Germination can occur in spring and plants then produce seed late in a shortened growing season. Seeds have little dormancy and most germinate in the autumn following their production. A few can last longer if trapped under dry cow-pats or tree branches. Six species of barley grass are present in New Zealand: Critesion glaucum, C. hystrix, C. jubatum, C. marinum, C. murinum and C. secalinum. Differences between the six species are small and they can all be managed in the same way (i.e. same control methods). Barley grass (Critesion murinum) is the most common and inhabits disturbed areas (e.g. stock camps) in pastures, and sometimes in crops. Barley grass is divided into two subspecies murinum and subspecies leporinum: the latter tends to occur in drier areas. Squirrel tail grass (C. jubatum) has long soft awns (which may have a pink tinge) and is only found in damp salt pans in Central Otago. Salt barley grass (C. marinum) and Mediterranean barley grass (C. hystrix) mostly grow on salt-affected pastures, salty marshes, and coastal areas. C. secalinum is a perennial grass, unlike the other five, which are annuals, and is only found near Porangahau in coastal Hawkes Bay. Provides good-quality feed in autumn and during winter when plants are in the vegetative stage. Used for cover-cropping in Europe, in olive groves to prevent erosion in mountainous areas in Spain, and in vineyards in Turkey. An additional benefit is that barley grass tolerates drought well.', 'Predominately a weed of high fertility soils, although salt barley grass and Mediterranean barley grass are prevalent on low fertility soils. Compete more strongly in pastures in nitrogen-enriched soils. Prevalent on stock camps, along fence lines and shelter belts and other disturbed or high usage areas where pasture cover is damaged in late summer and early autumn. Provides low quality forage during late spring as the plants begin to flower. Sheep avoid grazing barley grass when the seed heads emerge. Avoidance of barley grass places more pressure on better pasture species. Barley grass can tolerate conditions of water stress better than other species and being an annual, avoids summer drought. Perennial grasses on the other hand, will be selectively grazed over summer. Grazing pressure, in combination with water stress, can lead to the decline of perennial species in pastures and reduce their ability to compete against annual grass weeds, such as barley grass. This enables undesirable annual species to gain a stronger foothold over time. Sharp, awned seeds can penetrate fleeces, pelts, carcasses, hocks, mouths and eyes of grazing livestock. If seed contamination is severe, stock growth rates can be reduced. Fine wool sheep tend to pick up the seeds more easily than sheep with coarse wool, although the actual skin damage is less in sheep with fine wool. Lambs are much more susceptible than older sheep, as their skin is more easily penetrated. They spend more time lying on the ground, which increases the chance of them picking up barley grass seed. Sheep dogs sometimes pick up barley grass seeds between their toes, leading to sores and lameness.', 'As with most grass weeds, an integrated approach is important with a focus on maintaining a healthy cover of desirable, competitive pasture species – especially in late summer and autumn. Tools for this include grazing management, fertiliser, herbicide and physical removal of plants. Seeds have very little dormancy and do not survive for long in the soil; so that grazing management to prevent seed production can control barley grass within a few years. Summer: Identify areas of barley grass infestation from their seed heads and mark the areas on your farm map. Decide on the best method of control for the area depending on access to boom-spray, ease of controlled grazing, potential damage to pelts. (Is the area used for grazing lambs?) Lax grazing during summer helps maintain pasture cover and can reduce barley grass establishment in autumn. Autumn: Heavy grazing may be required in paddocks to be treated with herbicides (pastures must be short for some herbicides to work effectively). Removal of standing pasture will also increase access for boom-sprays and other equipment. Winter: Rest infested paddocks from grazing if possible. In response, barley grass produces plants with fewer tillers which have their growing points higher from the ground. Spring: Graze more heavily. Stock removes the growing point; the tiller dies and no seed is produced. Grazing pressure must be maintained to prevent new tillers and seed heads from being formed, or at least to reduce the height of the barley grass seed heads. This reduces the damage that seeds cause to sheep. Some pasture species and cultivars are more resistant to barley grass than others, often because they withstand summer drought better. Novel endophytes can help pastures resist weed invasion and spread. Endophytes can allow pasture species to be more drought tolerant and resistant to insect attack. This enables sown pasture species to grow more vigorously, making it more difficult for weeds to establish. Some high endophyte ryegrass cultivars and low-growing cultivars of cocksfoot seem to be more effective. Ensure soil fertility levels are appropriate as this can increase the vigour of sown pasture species and reduce barley grass establishment. Note that barley grass is often found on high fertility, disturbed areas such as stock camps, along fence lines, around gate ways and watering points. In these areas, it is difficult for competitive pasture species to establish and suppress barley grass. Clippings should be collected and dumped securely to prevent the seeds from ripening. Small numbers of plants can be grubbed or manually removed. Winter-cleaning: herbicides can be applied during vegetative stage at levels sufficient to selectively kill barley grass plants. Spraying barley grass in summer with glyphosate damages pasture species and creates a perfect seed bed for germination of surviving seeds. Herbicides used to control barley grass in pastures include the following: paraquat or glyphosate + simazine (At the green seed head stage, Yes, Yes, Severe, Severe), dalapon (Late autumn to early spring during vegetative growth, Moderate, Slight, No), dalapon + TCA (Late autumn to early spring during vegetative growth, Yes, Slight, No), ethofumesate (Mid-autumn until mid-winter, during vegetative growth, Yes, Not to ryegrass, Severe), propyzamide (Winter during vegetative growth, Yes, Severe, No). Effectiveness of herbicides depends on: Application rate, Soil moisture conditions and plant stress, Pasture height and size of plants being sprayed. As glyphosate will kill all plants it contacts, patches of bare ground (gaps) are created, this, neither glyphosate nor paraquat are recommended for barley grass control. Simazine can be added to glyphosate or paraquat to provide residual control of barley grass (simazine is residual in the soil and prevents seeds from germinating). Ethofumesate can be applied to ryegrass pastures (ryegrass is tolerant to ethofumesate), but ethofumesate kills clovers. Consult your farm consultant, industry rep or the New Zealand Agrichemical Manual for more information about chemical control. Suggestion based on size of infestation: Small patches: Remove manually or apply herbicide. Note that applying herbicide once flowering has started may allow seeds to form and patches to grow in successive years. 50% paddock cover: Apply herbicide. Graze laxly over summer and early autumn so that sown pasture species are not overgrazed. This enables sown species to grow vigorously after autumn rains and suppress barley grass. Keep lambs off affected paddocks. Most of paddock covered: Consider resowing, using recommended species of grasses with appropriate endophytes for the region.');

It is rare in Westland and Otago. It is now found in tropical and temperate countries throughout the world. Barnyard grass grows best in high fertility sites and under moderate moisture stress. Seeds germinate in late spring and the plants flower in summer. Plants die after seeds are shed. Individual plants can become quite large. Plants can grow and flower in photoperiods of 8 to 16 hours, but perform better in long day photoperiods. It seeds prolifically and can build up large seed reserves in the soil, making it hard to eliminate large populations. Barnyards grass has occasionally been grown as a grain and in some circumstances it can provide fodder for livestock. However it is not a reliable source of fodder.', 'Barnyard grass is rarely a problem in pasture because its seeds cannot germinate in the shade of other plants and it germinates when pasture species are growing quickly. Barnyard grass competes with summer-active crops, producing a considerable bulk of vegetation in late spring. It is a major weed of rice, and is known to reduce yields in maize and other crops.', 'Cultivation or mowing before plants set seed can give useful control in some situations. Crop rotation can be a useful tool for limiting the build-up of weeds. Continuous cropping with the same crop builds up weeds that match the growth patterns of the crop. This should be avoided if at all possible by alternating maize, for example, with non-grass crops. Weeds in maize are usually controlled with a mixture of pre-emergence herbicides The most common combination used in New Zealand is a mixture of a triazine, such as atrazine or terbuthylazine for broadleaf control, and a chloroacetamide like alachlor, metolachlor or acetochlor for the control of grass weeds. Pre-emergence herbicides must be activated either by mechanical incorporation or by rainfall before it can be taken up by emerging weed seedlings. As the crop grows it is important to monitor for weeds that have emerged despite the pre-emergent herbicide, so that post-emergent herbicides like nicosulfuron, mesotrione or topramezone can be applied early enough to be effective.');

Each bur contains two seeds.', 'Originated in South America and accidentally introduced into Australia in the early 1800s (near Bathurst, as well as other places) from contaminated grain or livestock imports. It is now one of the most widespread weeds in Australia and is common in many parts of the world. Bathurst bur found its way to New Zealand by the 1860s and in the 1890s was reported as spreading in many areas – notably around Gisborne, Auckland Province and Bay of Plenty. Most commonly found today in eastern areas of the North Island and in a few places in the South Island. Classified as ‘noxious’ in 1900 and now considered a ‘pest plant’ by many regional councils. Grows in pasture, on arable land, in coastal areas and in waste places, especially where the ground is bare of vegetation for part of the year. Usually germinates during late spring and early summer, produces burs in February and dies in early winter. Although mostly a summer-growing plant some seeds can germinate out of season so mature plants can sometimes be found at any time of the year. Of the two seeds present in each bur, generally only one will germinate in a single season. The other seed will remain dormant for a year or two. Burrs are usually spread by becoming attached to wool or socks! They can also float and are spread along watercourses. Plants are mildly poisonous to livestock, and can cause contact dermatitis in some people. Tends to occur in high fertility, moderately warm situations and is particularly common around stockyards, stock camps and tracks, gateways and races. Bathurst bur may become more widespread and problematical as climate change could result in higher temperatures and less rain in some areas. Young plants are mildly poisonous to stock, older plants have vicious spines, and produce burs that contaminate wool and socks, and can cause dermatitis in some people. Benefits? Absolutely none!', 'Bathurst bur is mainly a pasture weed but it is also a weed of summer growing crops. Contamination of pastures and stock can reduce agricultural productivity. A single bur in a pack of wool can lead to rejection or down grading the entire consignment. Burrs are easily spread from one place to another and once populations are established plants will repeatedly re-appear from buried seeds. Plants can out-compete and replace desirable grasses and clovers, and the spines discourage stock from grazing close to desirable plants leading to poor pasture utilisation. Burrs become entangled in wool, leading to its downgrading as they are difficult to remove. Burrs also damage the feet of sheep and other stock when they walk through dense patches.', 'Be careful not to import hay from farms where the weed is prevalent, and ensure contractors don’t bring it onto your farm from contaminated properties. Uncertified seed in summer crops such as maize, sorghum and sunflowers can also contain burs. Removing the first few plants that appear on the farm can pay big dividends by saving on future costs. Pulling plants out (carefully – watch those spines!) and putting them in plastic bags before burning or burying them very deeply is probably the best treatment for those first few. Take care not to spread the seed around. After using herbicides, competitive pastures must be maintained to reduce re-infestation. Grazing is not an effective method of control. Mowing is not usually an effective control method. Rotary slashing can be used but must be done before any burs are formed, and plants may still regrow afterwards. The best long term control option is probably pasture renewal, with a summer of fodder cropping. A large proportion of the dormant seed will then germinate and allow easier control. Establishment of more competitive and locally-appropriate pasture species may reduce the incidence of Bathurst bur by shading it out. A dense sward of sown pasture species, especially in late spring but preferably all year round, prevents plants from establishing. Control programmes should aim to prevent seeding for 3 or 4 years. In pasture young plants can be controlled with broadcast applications of 2,4-D or MCPA, preferably before any burs are produced. Metribuzin, picloram, dicamba, 2,4-DB, MCPB, atrazine and pendimethalin have all been used selectively in the appropriate crops, refer to specific product labels and cropping guides for their use. Mature plants in pasture will require spot treatment with herbicides which will damage either the grass or the clover (or in some cases both) component of the pasture sward, refer to table below for options. One recommendation is to spray before plants set seed with metsulfuron + penetrant, clopyralid or glyphosate. All of these will damage clovers: clopyralid does NOT damage grasses and will not result in bare ground but both have residual activity. Metsulfuron kills some species of grasses, but not all, and it again has residual activity. Glyphosate kills any green plants and results in bare ground in which new seedlings of Bathurst bur can emerge, but it has no residual activity. Clopyralid can contaminate lawn clippings and and these must NOT be composted. It is recommended that with the exception of 2,4-D all the chemicals below only be used as spot treatments in pasture. They may be used over larger waste areas. No biological control agents are available for Bathurst bur. A fungus (Colletotrichum orbiculare) that causes anthracnose and seedling blight in Bathurst bur was observed in New South Wales in 1948 and was tested as a control agent, but did not prove reliable enough to be of practical use.

However, deadly nightshade (Atropa bella-donna) is very rare in New Zealand. Black nightshade is the plant most often referred to New Zealand’s National Poisons Information Centre. It states “Black nightshade is not highly toxic and small accidental ingestions of a few berries or leaves rarely leads to symptoms. Toxicity would only be expected following ingestion of large amounts of unripe berries or other plant matter.” However, children should be advised not to eat the green unripe berries which are more poisonous than ripe black ones.', 'Originally from Europe and Asia, black nightshade has been introduced to many other countries and has thrived. In New Zealand it was first recorded in 1853. Plants are very variable in size and can produce as many as 168,000 seeds per plant or as few as 600. Each berry contains an average of about 60 seeds. Little or no dormancy appears to be present in the seeds after they are separated from the berries. However, seed buried in the soil can remain dormant for many years. Seeds are distributed in contaminated crops or vegetable matter, and also by birds and rodents that eat the berries. Seeds can germinate over long periods in late spring and summer. Apparently alternating temperatures promote germination, and exposure to light can also play a role. Stratification (storage of moist seed at low temperature) can also stimulate later germination. Plants growing at favourable times of the year can flower within 5 to 6 weeks. Plants are killed by frosts, so late-germinating plants may be killed before they can set seed. Both the leaves and fruits have been used as food in some countries. Note that only fully ripe fruit should be used as under-ripe berries may be toxic.

Pteridium esculentum is also found in Australia and the Society Islands but Pteridium aquilinum, a very close relative, is widespread throughout the world. Pteridium esculentum rapidly increased in area in New Zealand as early humans cleared and burned forests and it is now common throughout the country in open habitats. Bracken is a fern, reproducing by spores that germinate to produce a small prothallus This develops male and female sexual organs that in turn produce male and female gametes, resulting in the formation of a new fern plant. Bracken spores are very small and are released between late summer and autumn They can be carried for considerable distances on air currents. Bracken rhizomes were used by Maori as a starchy food, Dry bracken stalks have multiple uses as play things, from arrows to kite structures.', 'Tall-growing bracken can make stock access and mustering very difficult, Bracken, like ring fern, can form very dense cover, smothering useful pasture species, Bracken uses valuable soil nutrients for growth and these nutrients are locked up in the fronds until they eventually break down. Some strains of bracken appear to be more toxic than others, but all can be poisonous to livestock if large quantities are eaten, Bracken contains carcinogens that can cause cancerous lesions in livestock. Bracken competes strongly with young trees and is also a fire risk.', 'Bracken is rhizomatous and difficult to kill, Bracken commonly grows in poorer grazing land, therefore, its control may not be economically feasible. Grazing is not an effective method of control, but heavy treading by cattle can be used to crush the new fern shoots as they are emerging. Repeated mowing or crushing can be used as control measures. However, where bracken grows on steep hillsides this may not be practical. Establishment of new competitive pasture species, suited to local conditions, can be used after initial clearance of fern, and may, if adequately limed and fertilised, help to prevent reestablishment. Trees can form a dense canopy and shade out bracken but the trees must be protected from bracken when young. Bracken is generally very difficult to kill with herbicides, though it is susceptible to glyphosate and high rates of metsulfuron, both of which are damaging to grasses. Two selective herbicides – asulam and primisulfuron will control bracken within pine forests. Asulam should be applied without surfactant when releasing young trees. Asulam (Asulox) is selective in pastures and should be applied when bracken fronds are fully expanded but before they are affected by frost (late summer to early autumn). Its effect on the bracken will not be obvious until the following spring. No biological control agents are available for either species.');

Adult weevils commence egg laying in spring as soon as temperatures allow (average daily temp 10°C). Eggs are laid in the sheaths of grass tillers. After hatching the white legless larvae tunnel and feed within tillers. Large larvae may live outside the tillers and within the plant crown especially if the tillers are small. Each larvae may destroy up to eight ryegrass tillers during development to adult and are capable of moving to new plants when required.

They have large heads with very long antennae. They have wings and although they generally do not fly there are occasional mass flights when numbers are high. Females have a long ovipositor (egg-laying tube) which extends past and under the wings. The adult males “chirp”, by rubbing their wings together. There is just one generation a year but the life stages overlap. Eggs, which are white, ovoid-shaped, and about 0.3 cm long are laid singly, but loosely clustered, about 1 cm deep in damp soil. A single female cricket is capable of laying up to 2000 eggs between mid-February and early May. After hatching the nymphs take 2-4 months to mature into adults and then live for 2-3 months. The nymphs pass through 9-10 stages and resemble small adults but do not have wings, or in the case of females, ovipositors, until the 8th and 9th stages. Overwintering occurs as eggs. The smaller nymphs live and hide within pasture and this makes them difficult to detect. Larger nymphs and adults tend to shelter in cracks in soil or under cow pats and litter. Although found throughout the North Island and milder coastal regions of the South Island they are usually only economically important in Northland, Auckland, Waikato, Bay of Plenty, Hawkes Bay, Taranaki and Manawatu. Black field crickets, especially the nymphs, are often confused with several species of much smaller native crickets. These only grow to about 1 cm and crickets larger than this are likely to be black field crickets. Native crickets are also active during the day and when disturbed will jump and be easily seen. In contrast black field crickets are active at night and if disturbed during the day will run for shelter and remain hidden. When threatened they will jump quickly away. Black field crickets can also be identified by a distinctive white band around their middle.', 'Black field crickets are generally pests only in northern areas of New Zealand. Their significance is increased in long dry periods and in soils that crack in during these periods. They feed most commonly on the leaves and germinating seeds of grasses, especially ryegrasses, but also eat legumes and weeds. Their feeding, and the type of damage they cause, can be categorised into three types: Grazing, where adults and the larger nymphs compete with stock for food. Over one hectare 2 crickets/m2 will consume the equivalent of one sheep. In plague seasons as many as 20-40 crickets/m2 frequently occur and can cause losses of 30kg DM/ha/day. In dairy pasture an average density of 25 crickets/m2 can be responsible for 2000 kg DM/ha/yr lost production. During long dry periods the growing crowns of grasses are attacked often killing the plants and leaving the soil open to weed invasion. Sown, or self sown seedlings, may be destroyed by cricket feeding. The potential for long term pasture damage and unseen losses makes early detection of crickets important. In areas prone to cricket damage the density can be quickly assessed by pouring a weak detergent solution (4 mls dishwashing liquid in 10 L water) over a known area of pasture. This will “flush” crickets out of cracks in the soil and make it easy to count them and determine their density. A density of 10/m2 is considered economically damaging.', 'Populations of more than 10 crickets/m2 are economically damaging. Control of black field crickets is usually by using grain baits coated with an insecticide (maldison).

There are several stages and forms of cabbage aphids. Adults may have wings or they may be wingless. Immature aphids have a very similar appearance to the larger adults. All stages in the life cycle are present throughout the year but vary with season. Female aphids are parthenogenic and viviparous, that is they produce live young without mating. Males rarely occur but are similar in form to the winged female. Winged aphids fly throughout the year but large numbers are produced in spring (October/November) and autumn (February/March) when the main dispersal flights occur and new infestations arise. Established aphid colonies are made up of individuals of several generations of wingless aphids which remain on the plant they started life on. A single adult produces about 25 nymphs. The rate of growth of these is dependent mainly on temperature. During summer development to reproducing adult takes 7-16 days and populations can consequently build up rapidly. In cooler winter conditions development takes up to 60 days and populations do not reach such high levels. There are at least 15 generations per year. Mature wingless adults are about 2.0mm long and 1.0mm wide, dull green to grey in colour and covered with a whitish waxy powder. There are several small black markings on the back, and at the rear of the body are two small upright projections called siphunculi. The head is small and dark with red eyes and a pair of short slender antennae. Winged adults have two pairs of strongly veined wings which, when at rest, extend well beyond the rear of the body. In contrast to the wingless form, the whitish mealy powder is virtually absent. The black markings on the back are large and clearly visible giving the winged insect a striped appearance. The immature stages (nymphs) resemble the wingless form but are much smaller being about 0.5mm at birth. They pass through four moults before becoming adults and are found together with wingless adults in colonies on plants. Cabbage aphids are found on all plants in the cruciferous family: cabbage, rape, swedes, turnips, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, kale, mustard and some weed species. It is the most common aphid found on these plants and usually the most abundant.', 'Aphids feed by sucking plant juices, causing yellowing and curling of leaves and seed heads, and wilting and stunting of plants, particularly during hot dry weather. Colonies of aphids can severely reduce the vigour and yield potential of a crop especially if it is being grown for seed production. Heavily infected forage crops such as turnips and rape may also be unpalatable to stock. Cabbage aphids transmit a number of viruses within and between brassica crops e.g. cauliflower mosaic and turnip mosaic viruses which in turn cause reductions in crop yield, and often death of plants. Symptoms of infection include crinkling and distortion of foliage and stunted plants.', 'Several insecticides are registered for use against aphids in forage brassica crops. If using a spray these should be applied as early as possible to prevent aphid build up. Consult your farm consultant, industry representative or the New Zealand Agricultural Manual for more information about chemical control. The removal of weeds (e.g. wild turnip) that act as hosts for cabbage aphid can assist in limiting damage. Populations can be affected, sometimes dramatically, by an Entomophora fungus especially during autumn and periods of high humidity. This fungus kills the aphids and leaves their mummified bodies on the plant. On close inspection these appear as “brown furry” non-responsive aphids. A parasitic wasp (Diaeretus rapae) can also kill a large number of aphids but is not usually sufficient to suppress populations. Some brassica varieties offer increased tolerance to aphid attack.

Bourletiella hortensi is the most common. These are soft bodied insects varying in colour from brown to black and grow up to 1 mm in length. They are a type of Collembola commonly known as globular springtails. This name derives from them appearing to consist of two attached balls (hence globular) and a specialised appendage which enables them to spring very quickly into the air (hence springtail).

Early detection or better still prediction of damage is necessary to avoid seedling loss.', 'Routine spraying or using coated seed can be worthwhile but inspection of the soil to be sown should be undertaken especially if springtails have been a problem in the past.

They are a type of Collembola commonly known as globular springtails. This name derives from them appearing to consist of 2 attached balls (hence globular) and a specialised appendage which enables them to spring very quickly into the air (hence springtail and flea). The same animal is also known as lucerne flea. Clover flea is present throughout New Zealand only reaching pest status in localised areas of the North Island – dairy pastures in parts of Northland, South Auckland, Waikato and the Bay of Plenty. After mating female clover fleas lay their eggs in batches of 2 – 40. These usually hatch after 26 – 42 days depending on temperature. Eggs laid in late spring take longer to hatch and will not do so until they have undergone periods of dry conditions followed by declining soil temperatures and increasing soil temperatures. This avoids the eggs hatching during dry summer months when food may be scarce. After hatching the young clover flea passes through 7 moults increasing in size each time until they reach a maximum size of about 3mm. Females tend to be larger than males but both are yellow green in colour with brown mottling on their backs. The adults live for approximately 15 days during which time males and females mate and egg laying starts again.', 'Clover flea is present throughout New Zealand but severe damage only occurs to dairy pastures in localised areas of the North Island – parts of Northland, South Auckland, Waikato and the Bay of Plenty. Clover flea will feed on a range of legumes but white clover is the preferred food plant in New Zealand. Damage can also be caused to lucerne, subterranean clover and when numbers are very high to grasses. Damage to clover results from young nymphs eating small holes in the leaves, giving the leaves a speckled appearance, while feeding from older nymphs and adults produces window like openings in the leaves. In cases of heavy infestation only the veins and cuticle of the clover leaf remain. Pasture damage is caused in late spring when high numbers of nymphs and adults can be present. Numbers of nymphs and adults are lower during summer, when mainly eggs are present, but increase again in autumn when again damage can occur. Pasture production losses of up to 20% frequently occur and reductions in clover yield of up to 50% have been recorded. Compounding direct feeding losses is that stock will avoid eating pasture fouled by clover flea faeces.', 'Several insecticides are registered for use against clover flea (see below) and both spray and granular formulations can be successfully used. Applications should be applied when damage is first noticed or when high numbers of clover fleas are observed. At times repeat applications may be necessary to achieve good control. In this situation the most cost effective approach can be to use diflubenzuron in conjunction with another insecticide. Registered insecticides (active ingredients) for use against clover flea in pasture or clover seed crops are: chlorpyrifos, diazinon, diflubenzuron, dimethoate, fenitrothion and maldison.

INSERT INTO `agriculture_items` VALUES (50, 'pest', 'Clover Root Weevil', 'Sitona obsoletus', 'Major pest of clovers, both red and white cultivars but white clover often most severely attacked, Found throughout New Zealand, Adults feed on clover foliage leaving distinctive notches on leaf margins, Larvae are most the damaging stage destroying clover roots and root nodules, Infested pastures become clover deficient, Biological control has significantly reduced impact of this pest.', 'Clover root weevil (CRW) adults are mahogany-brown, 4-6 mm long, with a short, blunt nose. It can be difficult to tell adult CRW apart from other weevils that can also be found in pasture. Adult weevils are most abundant in autumn and spring. They lay their eggs on the pasture surface and when these hatch the larvae move into the soil seeking food and shelter. These are legless, creamy white grubs, 1-6 mm long with a brown head. They may be found by digging into the root zone under clover plants. Larvae are present throughout the year but are more abundant in late spring and late autumn. The larvae are generally much smaller than grass-grub larvae, which can be common in pastures, and they lack the distinctive C-shape that characterise grass grub. Clover root weevil has been present in New Zealand since at least 1994 but was not discovered until 1996. By 2006 it was present throughout the North Island and by 2015 throughout the South Island. The combination of a favourable environment, lack of competition for an abundant food resource, high reproductive capability of the weevil and a lack of natural enemies inevitably meant clover root weevil was going to become one of New Zealand’s most damaging pests of clover. There are two generations a year with adult populations peaking in early and late summer in the North Island and summer and autumn in the South Island. The adults can live for several months with the females laying up to several hundred eggs. Young larvae mainly feed on clover root nodules. As they mature they move onto the roots and stolons. Adults feed on clover leaves producing characteristic notching of leaf margins. Dispersal by flight occurs during the summer and autumn with the proportion of adults having flight or reproductive capability dependent on prevailing climatic and pasture conditions. While clover is abundant and summer rainfall high or irrigation used most weevils remain reproductive and stay in the pastures they lived in as larvae. When there is drought and clover is limited a large proportion of weevils stop being reproductive and instead develop flight muscles and disperse to new locations. Once they have located a suitable site the flight muscles atrophy and the weevils again become reproductive. Clover root weevil is a very proficient hitch-hiker in hay and on vehicles.', 'Feeding by adult CRW causes distinctive semi-circular notching on the edges of clover leaves. These notches are symmetrical and uniform, unlike the jagged or irregular damage caused by other pasture pests, such as slugs and caterpillars. While this damage can appear serious, generally, it does not cause significant damage in established pastures. Adult feeding can however, kill large numbers of clover seedlings in newly sown pasture. Although adult feeding damage is most noticeable, feeding by larvae is more damaging. The young larvae feed on root nodules and later the roots. This reduces the plant’s ability to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and reduces plant growth. A reduction in nitrogen fixed also impacts on the growth of other pasture plants and leads to an increased requirement for nitrogen fertiliser to be applied. Prior to the release of the biocontrol agent moderate populations of larvae (approx. 300/m2) have reduced clover production by 35% (1000kg DM/ha) annually with greatest losses occurring in spring. Without additional nitrogen it has been estimated a typical Waikato dairy farm would suffer a 16% reduction in net profit. An extra 180 kg N/ha was required on some farms to alleviate the impact of the weevil. During invasive periods larval numbers as high as 1800/m2 have been recorded. With the establishment of biological control numbers are now usually much less. Left unchecked MPI estimated clover root weevil could have cost New Zealand between $200m and $1b per annum. A cost: benefit analysis undertaken in 2015, has shown that for Southland alone the impact of the parasitoid wasp in supressing CRW was worth $2.3m pa for beef and lamb farms and $7 M pa for dairy farms.', 'During pasture establishment application of a foliar insecticide can be used close to seedling emergence to control adults and provide a window in which clover plants may establish before re-invasion by the weevil occurs. Seed coatings do not provide adequate protection against this pest and should not be relied on. Clover root weevil is difficult to control with insecticides in established pastures. Because the larvae live in the soil and are relatively immobile, and because New Zealand soils are high in organic matter which binds up insecticide, getting an insecticide to them is difficult to achieve. The adults are very mobile and although they can be killed, pastures are rapidly reinvaded from surrounding areas. Insecticides are harmful to the biocontrol agent. Clover root weevil is dependent on clover for its survival. When pastures are severely damaged destroying the remaining clover with a selective herbicide and/or cultivation followed by a farrow period leaving the pasture clover free for 6-8 months can cause the weevil population to die off and provide a clean pasture in which clover can be re-established. Drilling clover seed into a damaged pasture without removing the older clover plants should not be attempted as the weevils prefer seedlings and will concentrate their feeding on them. Biological control will not prevent seedling damage. Establishment of clover seedlings at sowing can be improved by utilising break crops rather than straight pasture to pasture rotations. A brassica or an all grass break crop will provide a clean paddock to which clover can be re-introduced. Clover management to maintain healthy plants is important. A healthy plant can tolerate more feeding pressure than an unhealthy plant. Adequate fertiliser should be used to keep clover growing in the presence of the weevil and to keep other pasture plants, which would normally benefit from clover nitrogen fixation, healthy as well. When clover is put under pressure by clover root weevil not only do the larvae consume nodules but the plants respond to the stress by reducing nodule production. In such instances compensatory nitrogen should be applied frequently to infested pastures in small amounts. Clover should not be put under stress by other factors, do not overgraze and avoid pugging of soil over winter. In 2006 AgResearch introduced a small parasitic wasp (Microctonus aethiopoides) as a biological control agent against clover root weevil. This wasp was released at numerous locations in both islands and is now very widely distributed. This biocontrol agent will not eliminate clover root weevil or the damage it causes, but it has reduced the impact of the weevil and in most locations the impact of the weevil has been negated by the biocontrol agent. However, there will always be some years and some areas where the biocontrol agent temporarily losses effectiveness either because of climatic events, use of insecticides that kill the wasp or pasture renewal events. Biological control will re-establish.');

Many species of amaranth are cultivated as vegetables, for grain production or for animal food in warmer countries.', 'Redroot in particular is a common weed of maize, mostly because it grows as the same time as the crop, but also because it grows quickly and can form large, aggressive plants, potentially at high densities. Prostrate amaranth is also found in some maize crops but is more common on lower growing vegetable and forage crops. Redroot and other species also often establish in orchards, in the bare, sprayed strip between the crop rows. Some species of amaranth contain high levels of oxalates and, under certain conditions contain high levels of nitrate. Many poisonings of livestock in New Zealand are associated with high nitrate levels in redroot.', 'Livestock readily graze amaranth. Therefore, care is required when nitrate levels might be high. Mowing plants taller than the crop, or where no desirable plants are present will give some control and may reduce seed production. In cropping cultivation can be used to gain control, but these species tend to emerge at the same time as maize crops. Stale seed bed methods can be effective for later sown crops. Redroot and other amaranth species are susceptible to most herbicides that do not affect the crop. In maize atrazine, acetochlor, mesotrione, nicosulfuron and topramezone are often used. In orchards or waste spaces glyphosate or glufosinate can both give good control. If using chlorsulfuron in cereals, amaranth seedlings should be treated when small.

Annual grass that mostly germinates in autumn and sets seed in summer. Germination can occur in spring and plants then produce seed late in a shortened growing season. Seeds have little dormancy and most germinate in the autumn following their production. A few can last longer if trapped under dry cow-pats or tree branches. Six species of barley grass are present in New Zealand: Critesion glaucum, C. hystrix, C. jubatum, C. marinum, C. murinum and C. secalinum. Differences between the six species are small and they can all be managed in the same way (i.e. same control methods). Barley grass (Critesion murinum) is the most common and inhabits disturbed areas (e.g. stock camps) in pastures, and sometimes in crops. Barley grass is divided into two subspecies murinum and subspecies leporinum: the latter tends to occur in drier areas. Squirrel tail grass (C. jubatum) has long soft awns (which may have a pink tinge) and is only found in damp salt pans in Central Otago. Salt barley grass (C. marinum) and Mediterranean barley grass (C. hystrix) mostly grow on salt-affected pastures, salty marshes, and coastal areas. C. secalinum is a perennial grass, unlike the other five, which are annuals, and is only found near Porangahau in coastal Hawkes Bay. Provides good-quality feed in autumn and during winter when plants are in the vegetative stage. Used for cover-cropping in Europe, in olive groves to prevent erosion in mountainous areas in Spain, and in vineyards in Turkey. An additional benefit is that barley grass tolerates drought well.', 'Predominately a weed of high fertility soils, although salt barley grass and Mediterranean barley grass are prevalent on low fertility soils. Compete more strongly in pastures in nitrogen-enriched soils. Prevalent on stock camps, along fence lines and shelter belts and other disturbed or high usage areas where pasture cover is damaged in late summer and early autumn. Provides low quality forage during late spring as the plants begin to flower. Sheep avoid grazing barley grass when the seed heads emerge. Avoidance of barley grass places more pressure on better pasture species. Barley grass can tolerate conditions of water stress better than other species and being an annual, avoids summer drought. Perennial grasses on the other hand, will be selectively grazed over summer. Grazing pressure, in combination with water stress, can lead to the decline of perennial species in pastures and reduce their ability to compete against annual grass weeds, such as barley grass. This enables undesirable annual species to gain a stronger foothold over time. Sharp, awned seeds can penetrate fleeces, pelts, carcasses, hocks, mouths and eyes of grazing livestock. If seed contamination is severe, stock growth rates can be reduced. Fine wool sheep tend to pick up the seeds more easily than sheep with coarse wool, although the actual skin damage is less in sheep with fine wool. Lambs are much more susceptible than older sheep, as their skin is more easily penetrated. They spend more time lying on the ground, which increases the chance of them picking up barley grass seed. Sheep dogs sometimes pick up barley grass seeds between their toes, leading to sores and lameness.', 'As with most grass weeds, an integrated approach is important with a focus on maintaining a healthy cover of desirable, competitive pasture species – especially in late summer and autumn. Tools for this include grazing management, fertiliser, herbicide and physical removal of plants. Seeds have very little dormancy and do not survive for long in the soil; so that grazing management to prevent seed production can control barley grass within a few years. Summer: Identify areas of barley grass infestation from their seed heads and mark the areas on your farm map. Decide on the best method of control for the area depending on access to boom-spray, ease of controlled grazing, potential damage to pelts. (Is the area used for grazing lambs?) Lax grazing during summer helps maintain pasture cover and can reduce barley grass establishment in autumn. Autumn: Heavy grazing may be required in paddocks to be treated with herbicides (pastures must be short for some herbicides to work effectively). Removal of standing pasture will also increase access for boom-sprays and other equipment. Winter: Rest infested paddocks from grazing if possible. In response, barley grass produces plants with fewer tillers which have their growing points higher from the ground. Spring: Graze more heavily. Stock removes the growing point; the tiller dies and no seed is produced. Grazing pressure must be maintained to prevent new tillers and seed heads from being formed, or at least to reduce the height of the barley grass seed heads. This reduces the damage that seeds cause to sheep. Some pasture species and cultivars are more resistant to barley grass than others, often because they withstand summer drought better. Novel endophytes can help pastures resist weed invasion and spread. Endophytes can allow pasture species to be more drought tolerant and resistant to insect attack. This enables sown pasture species to grow more vigorously, making it more difficult for weeds to establish. Some high endophyte ryegrass cultivars and low-growing cultivars of cocksfoot seem to be more effective. Ensure soil fertility levels are appropriate as this can increase the vigour of sown pasture species and reduce barley grass establishment. Note that barley grass is often found on high fertility, disturbed areas such as stock camps, along fence lines, around gate ways and watering points. In these areas, it is difficult for competitive pasture species to establish and suppress barley grass. Clippings should be collected and dumped securely to prevent the seeds from ripening. Small numbers of plants can be grubbed or manually removed. Winter-cleaning: herbicides can be applied during vegetative stage at levels sufficient to selectively kill barley grass plants. Spraying barley grass in summer with glyphosate damages pasture species and creates a perfect seed bed for germination of surviving seeds. Herbicides used to control barley grass in pastures include the following: paraquat or glyphosate + simazine (At the green seed head stage, Yes, Yes, Severe, Severe), dalapon (Late autumn to early spring during vegetative growth, Moderate, Slight, No), dalapon + TCA (Late autumn to early spring during vegetative growth, Yes, Slight, No), ethofumesate (Mid-autumn until mid-winter, during vegetative growth, Yes, Not to ryegrass, Severe), propyzamide (Winter during vegetative growth, Yes, Severe, No). Effectiveness of herbicides depends on: Application rate, Soil moisture conditions and plant stress, Pasture height and size of plants being sprayed. As glyphosate will kill all plants it contacts, patches of bare ground (gaps) are created, this, neither glyphosate nor paraquat are recommended for barley grass control. Simazine can be added to glyphosate or paraquat to provide residual control of barley grass (simazine is residual in the soil and prevents seeds from germinating). Ethofumesate can be applied to ryegrass pastures (ryegrass is tolerant to ethofumesate), but ethofumesate kills clovers. Consult your farm consultant, industry rep or the New Zealand Agrichemical Manual for more information about chemical control. Suggestion based on size of infestation: Small patches: Remove manually or apply herbicide. Note that applying herbicide once flowering has started may allow seeds to form and patches to grow in successive years. 50% paddock cover: Apply herbicide. Graze laxly over summer and early autumn so that sown pasture species are not overgrazed. This enables sown species to grow vigorously after autumn rains and suppress barley grass. Keep lambs off affected paddocks. Most of paddock covered: Consider resowing, using recommended species of grasses with appropriate endophytes for the region.');

Plants can grow and flower in photoperiods of 8 to 16 hours, but perform better in long day photoperiods.

Weeds in maize are usually controlled with a mixture of pre-emergence herbicides The most common combination used in New Zealand is a mixture of a triazine, such as atrazine or terbuthylazine for broadleaf control, and a chloroacetamide like alachlor, metolachlor or acetochlor for the control of grass weeds. Pre-emergence herbicides must be activated either by mechanical incorporation or by rainfall before it can be taken up by emerging weed seedlings.

Bathurst bur found its way to New Zealand by the 1860s and in the 1890s was reported as spreading in many areas – notably around Gisborne, Auckland Province and Bay of Plenty. Most commonly found today in eastern areas of the North Island and in a few places in the South Island. Classified as ‘noxious’ in 1900 and now considered a ‘pest plant’ by many regional councils. Grows in pasture, on arable land, in coastal areas and in waste places, especially where the ground is bare of vegetation for part of the year. Usually germinates during late spring and early summer, produces burs in February and dies in early winter. Although mostly a summer-growing plant some seeds can germinate out of season so mature plants can sometimes be found at any time of the year. Of the two seeds present in each bur, generally only one will germinate in a single season. The other seed will remain dormant for a year or two. Burrs are usually spread by becoming attached to wool or socks! They can also float and are spread along watercourses. Plants are mildly poisonous to livestock, and can cause contact dermatitis in some people. Tends to occur in high fertility, moderately warm situations and is particularly common around stockyards, stock camps and tracks, gateways and races. Bathurst bur may become more widespread and problematical as climate change could result in higher temperatures and less rain in some areas. Young plants are mildly poisonous to stock, older plants have vicious spines, and produce burs that contaminate wool and socks, and can cause dermatitis in some people. Benefits? Absolutely none!', 'Bathurst bur is mainly a pasture weed but it is also a weed of summer growing crops. Contamination of pastures and stock can reduce agricultural productivity. A single bur in a pack of wool can lead to rejection or down grading the entire consignment. Burrs are easily spread from one place to another and once populations are established plants will repeatedly re-appear from buried seeds. Plants can out-compete and replace desirable grasses and clovers, and the spines discourage stock from grazing close to desirable plants leading to poor pasture utilisation. Burrs become entangled in wool, leading to its downgrading as they are difficult to remove. Burrs also damage the feet of sheep and other stock when they walk through dense patches.', 'Be careful not to import hay from farms where the weed is prevalent, and ensure contractors don’t bring it onto your farm from contaminated properties. Uncertified seed in summer crops such as maize, sorghum and sunflowers can also contain burs. Removing the first few plants that appear on the farm can pay big dividends by saving on future costs. Pulling plants out (carefully – watch those spines!) and putting them in plastic bags before burning or burying them very deeply is probably the best treatment for those first few. Take care not to spread the seed around. After using herbicides, competitive pastures must be maintained to reduce re-infestation. Grazing is not an effective method of control. Mowing is not usually an effective control method. Rotary slashing can be used but must be done before any burs are formed, and plants may still regrow afterwards. The best long term control option is probably pasture renewal, with a summer of fodder cropping. A large proportion of the dormant seed will then germinate and allow easier control. Establishment of more competitive and locally-appropriate pasture species may reduce the incidence of Bathurst bur by shading it out. A dense sward of sown pasture species, especially in late spring but preferably all year round, prevents plants from establishing. Control programmes should aim to prevent seeding for 3 or 4 years. In pasture young plants can be controlled with broadcast applications of 2,4-D or MCPA, preferably before any burs are produced. Metribuzin, picloram, dicamba, 2,4-DB, MCPB, atrazine and pendimethalin have all been used selectively in the appropriate crops, refer to specific product labels and cropping guides for their use. Mature plants in pasture will require spot treatment with herbicides which will damage either the grass or the clover (or in some cases both) component of the pasture sward, refer to table below for options. One recommendation is to spray before plants set seed with metsulfuron + penetrant, clopyralid or glyphosate. All of these will damage clovers: clopyralid does NOT damage grasses and will not result in bare ground but both have residual activity. Metsulfuron kills some species of grasses, but not all, and it again has residual activity. Glyphosate kills any green plants and results in bare ground in which new seedlings of Bathurst bur can emerge, but it has no residual activity. Clopyralid can contaminate lawn clippings and and these must NOT be composted. It is recommended that with the exception of 2,4-D all the chemicals below only be used as spot treatments in pasture. They may be used over larger waste areas. No biological control agents are available for Bathurst bur. A fungus (Colletotrichum orbiculare) that causes anthracnose and seedling blight in Bathurst bur was observed in New South Wales in 1948 and was tested as a control agent, but did not prove reliable enough to be of practical use. Other insects and fungi attack Bathurst bur but outbreaks are spasmodic and none have given long-term control.');

Two valves split explosively and coil upwards, spreading the seeds up to a metre from the parent plant.', 'Originally from Europe and western Asia, bitter cress has now been introduced to North America, eastern Asia, Australia and New Zealand. First recorded in New Zealand in 1901. Flowers August to December. Plants can set seed within a few weeks of germinating, so several generations can occur in a year. One plant can produce up to 5000 seeds that can germinate immediately. However, if the seeds are in environments that do not favour germination they can survive for several years. Seeds are small and sticky when wet so can stick to footwear, enabling them be transported and dispersed. In a moist environment bitter cress can probably germinate, grow and set seed at any time of the year. Leaves have a hot, cress-like flavour and have been used as a garnish or flavouring in salads. Now found throughout the North Island and in eastern areas of the South Island, as well as on Stewart and Chatham Islands. Commonly found in damp gardens, along driveways, in cultivated or disturbed ground and can also be found growing in plant pots.', 'Bitter cress is probably not very competitive as a weed although if many individual plants germinate together they could limit the growth of later germinating species. Seeds generally do not germinate in the presence of competitive or shading vegetation such as pasture. Plants can act as hosts for common garden pests such as aphids. Wavy bitter cress is more abundant in Poverty Bay and has been noted as a weed of arable crops in that region. Bitter cress is rarely a pasture weed although it could interfere with establishment of a new pasture if present in high numbers. Young stems with their soft, finely-divided leaves break easily but later become tougher and can sprawl for long distances.', 'Hand weeding is very effective but must be repeated regularly, preferably before the plants set seed. Individual plants are easy to dislodge and uproot. Uprooted fruiting plants can continue shedding seed. Bitter cress is usually found in open places and the seeds probably don’t germinate under the cover of vegetation. Bitter cress also germinates from very close to the surface (less than 10 mm deep) and will not grow if the soil surface is dry. It germinates best in compacted, damp soils. Bitter cress (Cardamine hirsuta) is readily controlled by a wide range of herbicides including 2,4-D, glyphosate and many of those normally used in crop production.');

Margins are entire or shallowly lobed, sometimes coarsely toothed, narrowing to the leaf stalk, Flowers are white or pale mauve, up to 13 mm in diameter, with five pointed petals and a central column of fused yellow anthers. Five- to 10-flowered umbel-like inflorescences are carried on stalks up to 25 mm long. Plants flower from October through to May, Fruits are round berries about 7-10 mm in diameter, initially green to yellowish but turning glossy black when ripe. Occasionally plants have ripe berries that are green to pale yellow, Black nightshade is often confused with, and sometimes called ‘deadly nightshade’. However, deadly nightshade (Atropa bella-donna) is very rare in New Zealand. Black nightshade is the plant most often referred to New Zealand’s National Poisons Information Centre. It states “Black nightshade is not highly toxic and small accidental ingestions of a few berries or leaves rarely leads to symptoms. Toxicity would only be expected following ingestion of large amounts of unripe berries or other plant matter.” However, children should be advised not to eat the green unripe berries which are more poisonous than ripe black ones.', 'Originally from Europe and Asia, black nightshade has been introduced to many other countries and has thrived. In New Zealand it was first recorded in 1853. Plants are very variable in size and can produce as many as 168,000 seeds per plant or as few as 600. Each berry contains an average of about 60 seeds. Little or no dormancy appears to be present in the seeds after they are separated from the berries. However, seed buried in the soil can remain dormant for many years. Seeds are distributed in contaminated crops or vegetable matter, and also by birds and rodents that eat the berries. Seeds can germinate over long periods in late spring and summer. Apparently alternating temperatures promote germination, and exposure to light can also play a role. Stratification (storage of moist seed at low temperature) can also stimulate later germination. Plants growing at favourable times of the year can flower within 5 to 6 weeks. Plants are killed by frosts, so late-germinating plants may be killed before they can set seed. Both the leaves and fruits have been used as food in some countries. Note that only fully ripe fruit should be used as under-ripe berries may be toxic. Now abundant throughout the North and South Islands, as well as on the Kermadecs, Stewart and Chatham Islands. Commonly found in open places, especially on arable land, in waste places, dry river beds and roadsides. Especially common in frequently disturbed areas.', 'Black nightshade can grow quickly in summer and can be a serious competitor in some crops, Seeds, especially when green (and therefore more toxic), can sometimes contaminate crops such as peas, Can harbour insects and diseases that affect crops.', 'Hand weeding is effective but needs to be repeated, preferably before the plants set seed. Individual plants can be pulled out readily when young but become much harder to dislodge after branching starts. In many cases, Solanum nigrum is readily controlled by cultivation and by most herbicides. However it is resistant to some sulphonylurea herbicides, including chlorsulfuron (e.g. Glean), commonly used in cereal crops, and to metsulfuron-methyl (e.g. Escort), used for general weed control. In these cases a second herbicide needs to be added. Black nightshade is not killed by trifluralin so other herbicides must be used. If triazine herbicides like simazine are regularly used in situations such as orchards, then black nightshade can develop resistance to such herbicides. If such resistance does develop, black nightshade can be killed in peas with herbicides like MCPB and bentazone, or in maize, dicamba is effective.');

It is also a problem in pasture, plantation forests and other disturbed areas. Three native blackberry species are present in New Zealand: Rubus australis, Rubus cissoides and Rubus schmidelioides, These are found sprawling or climbing in native bush. Stems are long and semi-woody with backward pointing thorns, often obstructing humans or animals as they move through the bush. Seeds germinate in the spring, Stems root when they arch over and contact the ground, forming daughter plants, Seeds are mainly dispersed by birds feeding on the berries.

Goats fenced onto areas of blackberry or tethered near it can destroy plants completely. Manual removal: Individual plants or small patches can be dug out. However, ensure root crowns and stems are disposed of properly. If left on the ground they may re-sprout and form ne roots. Chemical control: Herbicides can be used between late summer and autumn, When spraying re-growth, make sure stems are at least one metre long with fully expanded leaves; large leaves absorb herbicides more effectively.

Pteridium esculentum is also found in Australia and the Society Islands but Pteridium aquilinum, a very close relative, is widespread throughout the world. Pteridium esculentum rapidly increased in area in New Zealand as early humans cleared and burned forests and it is now common throughout the country in open habitats. Bracken is a fern, reproducing by spores that germinate to produce a small prothallus This develops male and female sexual organs that in turn produce male and female gametes, resulting in the formation of a new fern plant. Bracken spores are very small and are released between late summer and autumn They can be carried for considerable distances on air currents. Bracken rhizomes were used by Maori as a starchy food, Dry bracken stalks have multiple uses as play things, from arrows to kite structures.', 'Tall-growing bracken can make stock access and mustering very difficult, Bracken, like ring fern, can form very dense cover, smothering useful pasture species, Bracken uses valuable soil nutrients for growth and these nutrients are locked up in the fronds until they eventually break down. Some strains of bracken appear to be more toxic than others, but all can be poisonous to livestock if large quantities are eaten, Bracken contains carcinogens that can cause cancerous lesions in livestock. Bracken competes strongly with young trees and is also a fire risk.', 'Bracken is rhizomatous and difficult to kill, Bracken commonly grows in poorer grazing land, therefore, its control may not be economically feasible. Grazing is not an effective method of control, but heavy treading by cattle can be used to crush the new fern shoots as they are emerging. Repeated mowing or crushing can be used as control measures. However, where bracken grows on steep hillsides this may not be practical. Establishment of new competitive pasture species, suited to local conditions, can be used after initial clearance of fern, and may, if adequately limed and fertilised, help to prevent reestablishment. Trees can form a dense canopy and shade out bracken but the trees must be protected from bracken when young. Bracken is generally very difficult to kill with herbicides, though it is susceptible to glyphosate and high rates of metsulfuron, both of which are damaging to grasses. Two selective herbicides – asulam and primisulfuron will control bracken within pine forests. Asulam should be applied without surfactant when releasing young trees. Asulam (Asulox) is selective in pastures and should be applied when bracken fronds are fully expanded but before they are affected by frost (late summer to early autumn). Its effect on the bracken will not be obvious until the following spring. No biological control agents are available for either species.');

With the successful introduction of a biocontrol agent and development of endophyte infected ryegrasses, Argentine stem weevil, although still a major pest, no longer has the impact it once had. The adults feed on a range of grasses but it is the larvae which develop and feed, predominantly, within the tillers of several agriculturally important grasses that are the main pest stage. These weevils are a major pest of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) in developed pastures, maize and cereal crops. Uncontrolled they have been estimated to cost the country up to $280m per annum. The adult weevil is a hard bodied compact beetle usually less than 3.5 mm long and 1.5 mm wide. It is grey-brown with three pale longitudinal stripes on its thorax. Its colour, small size and the fact that soil particles adhere to its body make adult weevils very difficult to detect by eye. Although it can be active during daylight, night is when it usually feeds on the leaf blades and lay its eggs. Adult weevils commence egg laying in spring as soon as temperatures allow (average daily temp 10°C). Eggs are laid in the sheaths of grass tillers. After hatching the white legless larvae tunnel and feed within tillers. Large larvae may live outside the tillers and within the plant crown especially if the tillers are small. Each larvae may destroy up to eight ryegrass tillers during development to adult and are capable of moving to new plants when required. The larvae pass through five stages of development before leaving the plants and pupating in soil. New adults commence laying eggs almost immediately after emergence from pupae giving rise to a new generation but egg laying is controlled by day-length and stops in Mid-March. The number of generations Argentine stem weevil can achieve in a year is driven by temperature. Pest status is reached when two or more generations occur as happens from Canterbury northwards. In Otago and Southland historically only one generation has generally occurred each year but anecdotal evidence suggests this has changed and stem weevil may be increasing in significance.

The presence of an endophytic fungus in perennial ryegrass makes it less susceptible to Argentine stem weevil attack. Endophytes do not occur in annual ryegrasses. Other pasture grasses, cereals and maize are also affected by Argentine stem weevil. They are often reported feeding on other plants e.g. brassica seedlings. In such instances this may be driven by shortage of grasses for food or the weevils may be seeking moisture.

Foliar sprays, prills drilled with the seed and seed coatings are available. If very high numbers of adults are present insecticide seed coating may not offer sufficient protection to avoid loss of seedlings.

When selecting perennial ryegrass cultivars for pastures, one of these endophytes should generally be used and form the backbone of Argentine stem weevil management.

Damage appears as small “shot” holes in leaves. In Australia they have been recorded damaging cereal seedlings and in summer collect in the stalks of cereals and maize clogging machinery during harvest.

They have large heads with very long antennae. They have wings and although they generally do not fly there are occasional mass flights when numbers are high. Females have a long ovipositor (egg-laying tube) which extends past and under the wings. The adult males “chirp”, by rubbing their wings together. There is just one generation a year but the life stages overlap. Eggs, which are white, ovoid-shaped, and about 0.3 cm long are laid singly, but loosely clustered, about 1 cm deep in damp soil. A single female cricket is capable of laying up to 2000 eggs between mid-February and early May. After hatching the nymphs take 2-4 months to mature into adults and then live for 2-3 months. The nymphs pass through 9-10 stages and resemble small adults but do not have wings, or in the case of females, ovipositors, until the 8th and 9th stages. Overwintering occurs as eggs. The smaller nymphs live and hide within pasture and this makes them difficult to detect. Larger nymphs and adults tend to shelter in cracks in soil or under cow pats and litter. Although found throughout the North Island and milder coastal regions of the South Island they are usually only economically important in Northland, Auckland, Waikato, Bay of Plenty, Hawkes Bay, Taranaki and Manawatu. Black field crickets, especially the nymphs, are often confused with several species of much smaller native crickets. These only grow to about 1 cm and crickets larger than this are likely to be black field crickets. Native crickets are also active during the day and when disturbed will jump and be easily seen. In contrast black field crickets are active at night and if disturbed during the day will run for shelter and remain hidden. When threatened they will jump quickly away. Black field crickets can also be identified by a distinctive white band around their middle.', 'Black field crickets are generally pests only in northern areas of New Zealand. Their significance is increased in long dry periods and in soils that crack in during these periods. They feed most commonly on the leaves and germinating seeds of grasses, especially ryegrasses, but also eat legumes and weeds. Their feeding, and the type of damage they cause, can be categorised into three types: Grazing, where adults and the larger nymphs compete with stock for food. Over one hectare 2 crickets/m2 will consume the equivalent of one sheep. In plague seasons as many as 20-40 crickets/m2 frequently occur and can cause losses of 30kg DM/ha/day. In dairy pasture an average density of 25 crickets/m2 can be responsible for 2000 kg DM/ha/yr lost production. During long dry periods the growing crowns of grasses are attacked often killing the plants and leaving the soil open to weed invasion. Sown, or self sown seedlings, may be destroyed by cricket feeding. The potential for long term pasture damage and unseen losses makes early detection of crickets important. In areas prone to cricket damage the density can be quickly assessed by pouring a weak detergent solution (4 mls dishwashing liquid in 10 L water) over a known area of pasture. This will “flush” crickets out of cracks in the soil and make it easy to count them and determine their density. A density of 10/m2 is considered economically damaging.', 'Populations of more than 10 crickets/m2 are economically damaging. Control of black field crickets is usually by using grain baits coated with an insecticide (maldison).

There are several stages and forms of cabbage aphids. Adults may have wings or they may be wingless. Immature aphids have a very similar appearance to the larger adults. All stages in the life cycle are present throughout the year but vary with season. Female aphids are parthenogenic and viviparous, that is they produce live young without mating. Males rarely occur but are similar in form to the winged female. Winged aphids fly throughout the year but large numbers are produced in spring (October/November) and autumn (February/March) when the main dispersal flights occur and new infestations arise. Established aphid colonies are made up of individuals of several generations of wingless aphids which remain on the plant they started life on. A single adult produces about 25 nymphs. The rate of growth of these is dependent mainly on temperature. During summer development to reproducing adult takes 7-16 days and populations can consequently build up rapidly. In cooler winter conditions development takes up to 60 days and populations do not reach such high levels. There are at least 15 generations per year. Mature wingless adults are about 2.0mm long and 1.0mm wide, dull green to grey in colour and covered with a whitish waxy powder. There are several small black markings on the back, and at the rear of the body are two small upright projections called siphunculi. The head is small and dark with red eyes and a pair of short slender antennae. Winged adults have two pairs of strongly veined wings which, when at rest, extend well beyond the rear of the body. In contrast to the wingless form, the whitish mealy powder is virtually absent. The black markings on the back are large and clearly visible giving the winged insect a striped appearance. The immature stages (nymphs) resemble the wingless form but are much smaller being about 0.5mm at birth. They pass through four moults before becoming adults and are found together with wingless adults in colonies on plants. Cabbage aphids are found on all plants in the cruciferous family: cabbage, rape, swedes, turnips, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, kale, mustard and some weed species. It is the most common aphid found on these plants and usually the most abundant.', 'Aphids feed by sucking plant juices, causing yellowing and curling of leaves and seed heads, and wilting and stunting of plants, particularly during hot dry weather. Colonies of aphids can severely reduce the vigour and yield potential of a crop especially if it is being grown for seed production. Heavily infected forage crops such as turnips and rape may also be unpalatable to stock. Cabbage aphids transmit a number of viruses within and between brassica crops e.g. cauliflower mosaic and turnip mosaic viruses which in turn cause reductions in crop yield, and often death of plants. Symptoms of infection include crinkling and distortion of foliage and stunted plants.', 'Several insecticides are registered for use against aphids in forage brassica crops. If using a spray these should be applied as early as possible to prevent aphid build up. Consult your farm consultant, industry representative or the New Zealand Agricultural Manual for more information about chemical control. The removal of weeds (e.g. wild turnip) that act as hosts for cabbage aphid can assist in limiting damage. Populations can be affected, sometimes dramatically, by an Entomophora fungus especially during autumn and periods of high humidity. This fungus kills the aphids and leaves their mummified bodies on the plant. On close inspection these appear as “brown furry” non-responsive aphids. A parasitic wasp (Diaeretus rapae) can also kill a large number of aphids but is not usually sufficient to suppress populations. Some brassica varieties offer increased tolerance to aphid attack.

Bourletiella hortensi is the most common. These are soft bodied insects varying in colour from brown to black and grow up to 1 mm in length. They are a type of Collembola commonly known as globular springtails. This name derives from them appearing to consist of two attached balls (hence globular) and a specialised appendage which enables them to spring very quickly into the air (hence springtail).

Early detection or better still prediction of damage is necessary to avoid seedling loss.', 'Routine spraying or using coated seed can be worthwhile but inspection of the soil to be sown should be undertaken especially if springtails have been a problem in the past.

They are a type of Collembola commonly known as globular springtails. This name derives from them appearing to consist of 2 attached balls (hence globular) and a specialised appendage which enables them to spring very quickly into the air (hence springtail and flea). The same animal is also known as lucerne flea. Clover flea is present throughout New Zealand only reaching pest status in localised areas of the North Island – dairy pastures in parts of Northland, South Auckland, Waikato and the Bay of Plenty. After mating female clover fleas lay their eggs in batches of 2 – 40. These usually hatch after 26 – 42 days depending on temperature. Eggs laid in late spring take longer to hatch and will not do so until they have undergone periods of dry conditions followed by declining soil temperatures and increasing soil temperatures. This avoids the eggs hatching during dry summer months when food may be scarce. After hatching the young clover flea passes through 7 moults increasing in size each time until they reach a maximum size of about 3mm. Females tend to be larger than males but both are yellow green in colour with brown mottling on their backs. The adults live for approximately 15 days during which time males and females mate and egg laying starts again.', 'Clover flea is present throughout New Zealand but severe damage only occurs to dairy pastures in localised areas of the North Island – parts of Northland, South Auckland, Waikato and the Bay of Plenty. Clover flea will feed on a range of legumes but white clover is the preferred food plant in New Zealand. Damage can also be caused to lucerne, subterranean clover and when numbers are very high to grasses. Damage to clover results from young nymphs eating small holes in the leaves, giving the leaves a speckled appearance, while feeding from older nymphs and adults produces window like openings in the leaves. In cases of heavy infestation only the veins and cuticle of the clover leaf remain. Pasture damage is caused in late spring when high numbers of nymphs and adults can be present. Numbers of nymphs and adults are lower during summer, when mainly eggs are present, but increase again in autumn when again damage can occur. Pasture production losses of up to 20% frequently occur and reductions in clover yield of up to 50% have been recorded. Compounding direct feeding losses is that stock will avoid eating pasture fouled by clover flea faeces.', 'Several insecticides are registered for use against clover flea (see below) and both spray and granular formulations can be successfully used. Applications should be applied when damage is first noticed or when high numbers of clover fleas are observed. At times repeat applications may be necessary to achieve good control. In this situation the most cost effective approach can be to use diflubenzuron in conjunction with another insecticide. Registered insecticides (active ingredients) for use against clover flea in pasture or clover seed crops are: chlorpyrifos, diazinon, diflubenzuron, dimethoate, fenitrothion and maldison.

INSERT INTO `agriculture_items` VALUES (70, 'pest', 'Clover Root Weevil', 'Sitona obsoletus', 'Major pest of clovers, both red and white cultivars but white clover often most severely attacked, Found throughout New Zealand, Adults feed on clover foliage leaving distinctive notches on leaf margins, Larvae are most the damaging stage destroying clover roots and root nodules, Infested pastures become clover deficient, Biological control has significantly reduced impact of this pest.', 'Clover root weevil (CRW) adults are mahogany-brown, 4-6 mm long, with a short, blunt nose. It can be difficult to tell adult CRW apart from other weevils that can also be found in pasture. Adult weevils are most abundant in autumn and spring. They lay their eggs on the pasture surface and when these hatch the larvae move into the soil seeking food and shelter. These are legless, creamy white grubs, 1-6 mm long with a brown head. They may be found by digging into the root zone under clover plants. Larvae are present throughout the year but are more abundant in late spring and late autumn. The larvae are generally much smaller than grass-grub larvae, which can be common in pastures, and they lack the distinctive C-shape that characterise grass grub. Clover root weevil has been present in New Zealand since at least 1994 but was not discovered until 1996. By 2006 it was present throughout the North Island and by 2015 throughout the South Island. The combination of a favourable environment, lack of competition for an abundant food resource, high reproductive capability of the weevil and a lack of natural enemies inevitably meant clover root weevil was going to become one of New Zealand’s most damaging pests of clover. There are two generations a year with adult populations peaking in early and late summer in the North Island and summer and autumn in the South Island. The adults can live for several months with the females laying up to several hundred eggs. Young larvae mainly feed on clover root nodules. As they mature they move onto the roots and stolons. Adults feed on clover leaves producing characteristic notching of leaf margins. Dispersal by flight occurs during the summer and autumn with the proportion of adults having flight or reproductive capability dependent on prevailing climatic and pasture conditions. While clover is abundant and summer rainfall high or irrigation used most weevils remain reproductive and stay in the pastures they lived in as larvae. When there is drought and clover is limited a large proportion of weevils stop being reproductive and instead develop flight muscles and disperse to new locations. Once they have located a suitable site the flight muscles atrophy and the weevils again become reproductive. Clover root weevil is a very proficient hitch-hiker in hay and on vehicles.', 'Feeding by adult CRW causes distinctive semi-circular notching on the edges of clover leaves. These notches are symmetrical and uniform, unlike the jagged or irregular damage caused by other pasture pests, such as slugs and caterpillars. While this damage can appear serious, generally, it does not cause significant damage in established pastures. Adult feeding can however, kill large numbers of clover seedlings in newly sown pasture. Although adult feeding damage is most noticeable, feeding by larvae is more damaging. The young larvae feed on root nodules and later the roots. This reduces the plant’s ability to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and reduces plant growth. A reduction in nitrogen fixed also impacts on the growth of other pasture plants and leads to an increased requirement for nitrogen fertiliser to be applied. Prior to the release of the biocontrol agent moderate populations of larvae (approx. 300/m2) have reduced clover production by 35% (1000kg DM/ha) annually with greatest losses occurring in spring. Without additional nitrogen it has been estimated a typical Waikato dairy farm would suffer a 16% reduction in net profit. An extra 180 kg N/ha was required on some farms to alleviate the impact of the weevil. During invasive periods larval numbers as high as 1800/m2 have been recorded. With the establishment of biological control numbers are now usually much less. Left unchecked MPI estimated clover root weevil could have cost New Zealand between $200m and $1b per annum. A cost: benefit analysis undertaken in 2015, has shown that for Southland alone the impact of the parasitoid wasp in supressing CRW was worth $2.3m pa for beef and lamb farms and $7 M pa for dairy farms.', 'During pasture establishment application of a foliar insecticide can be used close to seedling emergence to control adults and provide a window in which clover plants may establish before re-invasion by the weevil occurs. Seed coatings do not provide adequate protection against this pest and should not be relied on. Clover root weevil is difficult to control with insecticides in established pastures. Because the larvae live in the soil and are relatively immobile, and because New Zealand soils are high in organic matter which binds up insecticide, getting an insecticide to them is difficult to achieve. The adults are very mobile and although they can be killed, pastures are rapidly reinvaded from surrounding areas. Insecticides are harmful to the biocontrol agent. Clover root weevil is dependent on clover for its survival. When pastures are severely damaged destroying the remaining clover with a selective herbicide and/or cultivation followed by a farrow period leaving the pasture clover free for 6-8 months can cause the weevil population to die off and provide a clean pasture in which clover can be re-established. Drilling clover seed into a damaged pasture without removing the older clover plants should not be attempted as the weevils prefer seedlings and will concentrate their feeding on them. Biological control will not prevent seedling damage. Establishment of clover seedlings at sowing can be improved by utilising break crops rather than straight pasture to pasture rotations. A brassica or an all grass break crop will provide a clean paddock to which clover can be re-introduced. Clover management to maintain healthy plants is important. A healthy plant can tolerate more feeding pressure than an unhealthy plant. Adequate fertiliser should be used to keep clover growing in the presence of the weevil and to keep other pasture plants, which would normally benefit from clover nitrogen fixation, healthy as well. When clover is put under pressure by clover root weevil not only do the larvae consume nodules but the plants respond to the stress by reducing nodule production. In such instances compensatory nitrogen should be applied frequently to infested pastures in small amounts. Clover should not be put under stress by other factors, do not overgraze and avoid pugging of soil over winter. In 2006 AgResearch introduced a small parasitic wasp (Microctonus aethiopoides) as a biological control agent against clover root weevil. This wasp was released at numerous locations in both islands and is now very widely distributed. This biocontrol agent will not eliminate clover root weevil or the damage it causes, but it has reduced the impact of the weevil and in most locations the impact of the weevil has been negated by the biocontrol agent.

Aquatic alligator weed can rapidly spread in streams and drainage canals, clogging them with vegetation and trapping sediments, thus increasing risk of flooding. In natural wetland areas alligator weed is a threat to native flora and fauna and is extremely difficult to eradicate once established in such a habitat. Alligator weed is listed in the National Pest Plant Accord and it is therefore illegal to propagate and knowingly spread this plant.', 'Ensure that alligator weed fragments are not carried on vehicles or equipment.

Some are also serious weeds of summer crops, notably maize, Originating from warm countries, amaranths tend to germinate in late spring, grow and flower in the summer. Almost all of the species found here are annual species and die after flowering or with the first frosts, Amaranths are C4 plants, meaning that their photosynthesis pathways produce 4-carbon sugars rather than 3-carbon sugars. They can tolerate warmer and drier conditions than our winter-growing species.', 'All the species of Amaranthus originated in tropical and subtropical countries, some in North and Central America, some in Europe and Asia.

Most of the species found in New Zealand are annuals but one or two species can persist as short-lived perennials, especially in frost-free places. Being from the tropics or subtropics all species are sensitive to and killed by frosts. Some species are used as ornamental garden plants and some are grown for their grain production. Many species of amaranth are cultivated as vegetables, for grain production or for animal food in warmer countries.', 'Redroot in particular is a common weed of maize, mostly because it grows as the same time as the crop, but also because it grows quickly and can form large, aggressive plants, potentially at high densities. Prostrate amaranth is also found in some maize crops but is more common on lower growing vegetable and forage crops. Redroot and other species also often establish in orchards, in the bare, sprayed strip between the crop rows. Some species of amaranth contain high levels of oxalates and, under certain conditions contain high levels of nitrate. Many poisonings of livestock in New Zealand are associated with high nitrate levels in redroot.', 'Livestock readily graze amaranth. Therefore, care is required when nitrate levels might be high. Mowing plants taller than the crop, or where no desirable plants are present will give some control and may reduce seed production. In cropping cultivation can be used to gain control, but these species tend to emerge at the same time as maize crops. Stale seed bed methods can be effective for later sown crops. Redroot and other amaranth species are susceptible to most herbicides that do not affect the crop. In maize atrazine, acetochlor, mesotrione, nicosulfuron and topramezone are often used. In orchards or waste spaces glyphosate or glufosinate can both give good control. If using chlorsulfuron in cereals, amaranth seedlings should be treated when small. Trifluralin, applied and incorporated before the crop is sown, is effective. Some commonly used herbicides like clopyralid or ioxynil will not control these species.');

Annual grass that mostly germinates in autumn and sets seed in summer. Germination can occur in spring and plants then produce seed late in a shortened growing season. Seeds have little dormancy and most germinate in the autumn following their production. A few can last longer if trapped under dry cow-pats or tree branches. Six species of barley grass are present in New Zealand: Critesion glaucum, C. hystrix, C. jubatum, C. marinum, C. murinum and C. secalinum. Differences between the six species are small and they can all be managed in the same way (i.e. same control methods). Barley grass (Critesion murinum) is the most common and inhabits disturbed areas (e.g. stock camps) in pastures, and sometimes in crops. Barley grass is divided into two subspecies murinum and subspecies leporinum: the latter tends to occur in drier areas. Squirrel tail grass (C. jubatum) has long soft awns (which may have a pink tinge) and is only found in damp salt pans in Central Otago. Salt barley grass (C. marinum) and Mediterranean barley grass (C. hystrix) mostly grow on salt-affected pastures, salty marshes, and coastal areas. C. secalinum is a perennial grass, unlike the other five, which are annuals, and is only found near Porangahau in coastal Hawkes Bay. Provides good-quality feed in autumn and during winter when plants are in the vegetative stage. Used for cover-cropping in Europe, in olive groves to prevent erosion in mountainous areas in Spain, and in vineyards in Turkey. An additional benefit is that barley grass tolerates drought well.', 'Predominately a weed of high fertility soils, although salt barley grass and Mediterranean barley grass are prevalent on low fertility soils. Compete more strongly in pastures in nitrogen-enriched soils. Prevalent on stock camps, along fence lines and shelter belts and other disturbed or high usage areas where pasture cover is damaged in late summer and early autumn. Provides low quality forage during late spring as the plants begin to flower. Sheep avoid grazing barley grass when the seed heads emerge. Avoidance of barley grass places more pressure on better pasture species. Barley grass can tolerate conditions of water stress better than other species and being an annual, avoids summer drought. Perennial grasses on the other hand, will be selectively grazed over summer. Grazing pressure, in combination with water stress, can lead to the decline of perennial species in pastures and reduce their ability to compete against annual grass weeds, such as barley grass. This enables undesirable annual species to gain a stronger foothold over time. Sharp, awned seeds can penetrate fleeces, pelts, carcasses, hocks, mouths and eyes of grazing livestock. If seed contamination is severe, stock growth rates can be reduced. Fine wool sheep tend to pick up the seeds more easily than sheep with coarse wool, although the actual skin damage is less in sheep with fine wool. Lambs are much more susceptible than older sheep, as their skin is more easily penetrated. They spend more time lying on the ground, which increases the chance of them picking up barley grass seed. Sheep dogs sometimes pick up barley grass seeds between their toes, leading to sores and lameness.', 'As with most grass weeds, an integrated approach is important with a focus on maintaining a healthy cover of desirable, competitive pasture species – especially in late summer and autumn. Tools for this include grazing management, fertiliser, herbicide and physical removal of plants. Seeds have very little dormancy and do not survive for long in the soil; so that grazing management to prevent seed production can control barley grass within a few years. Summer: Identify areas of barley grass infestation from their seed heads and mark the areas on your farm map. Decide on the best method of control for the area depending on access to boom-spray, ease of controlled grazing, potential damage to pelts. (Is the area used for grazing lambs?) Lax grazing during summer helps maintain pasture cover and can reduce barley grass establishment in autumn. Autumn: Heavy grazing may be required in paddocks to be treated with herbicides (pastures must be short for some herbicides to work effectively). Removal of standing pasture will also increase access for boom-sprays and other equipment. Winter: Rest infested paddocks from grazing if possible. In response, barley grass produces plants with fewer tillers which have their growing points higher from the ground. Spring: Graze more heavily. Stock removes the growing point; the tiller dies and no seed is produced. Grazing pressure must be maintained to prevent new tillers and seed heads from being formed, or at least to reduce the height of the barley grass seed heads. This reduces the damage that seeds cause to sheep. Some pasture species and cultivars are more resistant to barley grass than others, often because they withstand summer drought better. Novel endophytes can help pastures resist weed invasion and spread. Endophytes can allow pasture species to be more drought tolerant and resistant to insect attack. This enables sown pasture species to grow more vigorously, making it more difficult for weeds to establish. Some high endophyte ryegrass cultivars and low-growing cultivars of cocksfoot seem to be more effective. Ensure soil fertility levels are appropriate as this can increase the vigour of sown pasture species and reduce barley grass establishment. Note that barley grass is often found on high fertility, disturbed areas such as stock camps, along fence lines, around gate ways and watering points. In these areas, it is difficult for competitive pasture species to establish and suppress barley grass. Clippings should be collected and dumped securely to prevent the seeds from ripening. Small numbers of plants can be grubbed or manually removed. Winter-cleaning: herbicides can be applied during vegetative stage at levels sufficient to selectively kill barley grass plants. Spraying barley grass in summer with glyphosate damages pasture species and creates a perfect seed bed for germination of surviving seeds. Herbicides used to control barley grass in pastures include the following: paraquat or glyphosate + simazine (At the green seed head stage, Yes, Yes, Severe, Severe), dalapon (Late autumn to early spring during vegetative growth, Moderate, Slight, No), dalapon + TCA (Late autumn to early spring during vegetative growth, Yes, Slight, No), ethofumesate (Mid-autumn until mid-winter, during vegetative growth, Yes, Not to ryegrass, Severe), propyzamide (Winter during vegetative growth, Yes, Severe, No). Effectiveness of herbicides depends on: Application rate, Soil moisture conditions and plant stress, Pasture height and size of plants being sprayed. As glyphosate will kill all plants it contacts, patches of bare ground (gaps) are created, this, neither glyphosate nor paraquat are recommended for barley grass control. Simazine can be added to glyphosate or paraquat to provide residual control of barley grass (simazine is residual in the soil and prevents seeds from germinating). Ethofumesate can be applied to ryegrass pastures (ryegrass is tolerant to ethofumesate), but ethofumesate kills clovers. Consult your farm consultant, industry rep or the New Zealand Agrichemical Manual for more information about chemical control. Suggestion based on size of infestation: Small patches: Remove manually or apply herbicide. Note that applying herbicide once flowering has started may allow seeds to form and patches to grow in successive years. 50% paddock cover: Apply herbicide. Graze laxly over summer and early autumn so that sown pasture species are not overgrazed. This enables sown species to grow vigorously after autumn rains and suppress barley grass. Keep lambs off affected paddocks. Most of paddock covered: Consider resowing, using recommended species of grasses with appropriate endophytes for the region.');

It is rare in Westland and Otago. It is now found in tropical and temperate countries throughout the world. Barnyard grass grows best in high fertility sites and under moderate moisture stress. Seeds germinate in late spring and the plants flower in summer. Plants die after seeds are shed. Individual plants can become quite large. Plants can grow and flower in photoperiods of 8 to 16 hours, but perform better in long day photoperiods. It seeds prolifically and can build up large seed reserves in the soil, making it hard to eliminate large populations. Barnyards grass has occasionally been grown as a grain and in some circumstances it can provide fodder for livestock. However it is not a reliable source of fodder.', 'Barnyard grass is rarely a problem in pasture because its seeds cannot germinate in the shade of other plants and it germinates when pasture species are growing quickly. Barnyard grass competes with summer-active crops, producing a considerable bulk of vegetation in late spring. It is a major weed of rice, and is known to reduce yields in maize and other crops.', 'Cultivation or mowing before plants set seed can give useful control in some situations. Crop rotation can be a useful tool for limiting the build-up of weeds. Continuous cropping with the same crop builds up weeds that match the growth patterns of the crop. This should be avoided if at all possible by alternating maize, for example, with non-grass crops. Weeds in maize are usually controlled with a mixture of pre-emergence herbicides The most common combination used in New Zealand is a mixture of a triazine, such as atrazine or terbuthylazine for broadleaf control, and a chloroacetamide like alachlor, metolachlor or acetochlor for the control of grass weeds. Pre-emergence herbicides must be activated either by mechanical incorporation or by rainfall before it can be taken up by emerging weed seedlings. As the crop grows it is important to monitor for weeds that have emerged despite the pre-emergent herbicide, so that post-emergent herbicides like nicosulfuron, mesotrione or topramezone can be applied early enough to be effective.');

Each bur contains two seeds.', 'Originated in South America and accidentally introduced into Australia in the early 1800s (near Bathurst, as well as other places) from contaminated grain or livestock imports. It is now one of the most widespread weeds in Australia and is common in many parts of the world. Bathurst bur found its way to New Zealand by the 1860s and in the 1890s was reported as spreading in many areas – notably around Gisborne, Auckland Province and Bay of Plenty. Most commonly found today in eastern areas of the North Island and in a few places in the South Island. Classified as ‘noxious’ in 1900 and now considered a ‘pest plant’ by many regional councils. Grows in pasture, on arable land, in coastal areas and in waste places, especially where the ground is bare of vegetation for part of the year. Usually germinates during late spring and early summer, produces burs in February and dies in early winter. Although mostly a summer-growing plant some seeds can germinate out of season so mature plants can sometimes be found at any time of the year. Of the two seeds present in each bur, generally only one will germinate in a single season. The other seed will remain dormant for a year or two. Burrs are usually spread by becoming attached to wool or socks! They can also float and are spread along watercourses. Plants are mildly poisonous to livestock, and can cause contact dermatitis in some people. Tends to occur in high fertility, moderately warm situations and is particularly common around stockyards, stock camps and tracks, gateways and races. Bathurst bur may become more widespread and problematical as climate change could result in higher temperatures and less rain in some areas. Young plants are mildly poisonous to stock, older plants have vicious spines, and produce burs that contaminate wool and socks, and can cause dermatitis in some people. Benefits? Absolutely none!', 'Bathurst bur is mainly a pasture weed but it is also a weed of summer growing crops. Contamination of pastures and stock can reduce agricultural productivity. A single bur in a pack of wool can lead to rejection or down grading the entire consignment. Burrs are easily spread from one place to another and once populations are established plants will repeatedly re-appear from buried seeds. Plants can out-compete and replace desirable grasses and clovers, and the spines discourage stock from grazing close to desirable plants leading to poor pasture utilisation. Burrs become entangled in wool, leading to its downgrading as they are difficult to remove. Burrs also damage the feet of sheep and other stock when they walk through dense patches.', 'Be careful not to import hay from farms where the weed is prevalent, and ensure contractors don’t bring it onto your farm from contaminated properties. Uncertified seed in summer crops such as maize, sorghum and sunflowers can also contain burs. Removing the first few plants that appear on the farm can pay big dividends by saving on future costs. Pulling plants out (carefully – watch those spines!) and putting them in plastic bags before burning or burying them very deeply is probably the best treatment for those first few. Take care not to spread the seed around. After using herbicides, competitive pastures must be maintained to reduce re-infestation. Grazing is not an effective method of control. Mowing is not usually an effective control method. Rotary slashing can be used but must be done before any burs are formed, and plants may still regrow afterwards. The best long term control option is probably pasture renewal, with a summer of fodder cropping. A large proportion of the dormant seed will then germinate and allow easier control. Establishment of more competitive and locally-appropriate pasture species may reduce the incidence of Bathurst bur by shading it out. A dense sward of sown pasture species, especially in late spring but preferably all year round, prevents plants from establishing. Control programmes should aim to prevent seeding for 3 or 4 years. In pasture young plants can be controlled with broadcast applications of 2,4-D or MCPA, preferably before any burs are produced. Metribuzin, picloram, dicamba, 2,4-DB, MCPB, atrazine and pendimethalin have all been used selectively in the appropriate crops, refer to specific product labels and cropping guides for their use. Mature plants in pasture will require spot treatment with herbicides which will damage either the grass or the clover (or in some cases both) component of the pasture sward, refer to table below for options. One recommendation is to spray before plants set seed with metsulfuron + penetrant, clopyralid or glyphosate. All of these will damage clovers: clopyralid does NOT damage grasses and will not result in bare ground but both have residual activity. Metsulfuron kills some species of grasses, but not all, and it again has residual activity. Glyphosate kills any green plants and results in bare ground in which new seedlings of Bathurst bur can emerge, but it has no residual activity. Clopyralid can contaminate lawn clippings and and these must NOT be composted. It is recommended that with the exception of 2,4-D all the chemicals below only be used as spot treatments in pasture. They may be used over larger waste areas. No biological control agents are available for Bathurst bur. A fungus (Colletotrichum orbiculare) that causes anthracnose and seedling blight in Bathurst bur was observed in New South Wales in 1948 and was tested as a control agent, but did not prove reliable enough to be of practical use.

However, deadly nightshade (Atropa bella-donna) is very rare in New Zealand. Black nightshade is the plant most often referred to New Zealand’s National Poisons Information Centre. It states “Black nightshade is not highly toxic and small accidental ingestions of a few berries or leaves rarely leads to symptoms. Toxicity would only be expected following ingestion of large amounts of unripe berries or other plant matter.” However, children should be advised not to eat the green unripe berries which are more poisonous than ripe black ones.', 'Originally from Europe and Asia, black nightshade has been introduced to many other countries and has thrived. In New Zealand it was first recorded in 1853. Plants are very variable in size and can produce as many as 168,000 seeds per plant or as few as 600. Each berry contains an average of about 60 seeds. Little or no dormancy appears to be present in the seeds after they are separated from the berries. However, seed buried in the soil can remain dormant for many years. Seeds are distributed in contaminated crops or vegetable matter, and also by birds and rodents that eat the berries. Seeds can germinate over long periods in late spring and summer. Apparently alternating temperatures promote germination, and exposure to light can also play a role. Stratification (storage of moist seed at low temperature) can also stimulate later germination. Plants growing at favourable times of the year can flower within 5 to 6 weeks. Plants are killed by frosts, so late-germinating plants may be killed before they can set seed. Both the leaves and fruits have been used as food in some countries. Note that only fully ripe fruit should be used as under-ripe berries may be toxic.

Biological control: Blackberry rust (Phragmidium violaceum), Native to Europe, the rust was first discovered here in 1990 and is thought to have blown over from Australia, The rust will infect most plants; some may have immunity to it, Causes small (2-3 mm diameter) purple-brown spots on the upper surface of the leaves and yellow or black powdery spots on the underside of leaves, There are different strains of the rust but telling them apart is very difficult, Signs of the rust can be seen any time of the year but are most prominent in autumn, In the summer the rust produces yellow spores: heavily infected leaves are killed, Manually spreading the rust won’t help; plants not affected will probably be immune to it. However, slashing plants can increase their vulnerability to rust.');
INSERT INTO `agriculture_items` VALUES (80, 'weed', 'Bracken', 'Pteridium esculentum', 'Bracken is a fern, producing spores not seeds, which is native to New Zealand, It spreads by means of underground stems (rhizomes) that send up leaves at intervals, It is taller-growing than ring fern, usually up to 1.5 m tall, Rhizomes are stiff, 5-15 mm thick, and branch frequently, Stipes (leaf stalks) are erect, rigid, dark brown, glossy but hairy when young, The main axis of the leaf is stout, brown and hairy when young, Fronds (leaves) are dark green, up to 1 m long, unrolling as they grow, Spore-bearing organs (sporangia) are borne along the underside margins of the smallest leaf segments, Although bracken has been used as human food in New Zealand, parts of the plant are toxic and carcinogenic to humans and livestock, Plants are very ‘plastic’ in behaviour, being small and stunted in dry rocky places and sometimes reaching 4 m high on forest margins, Dry, dead fronds burn very readily.', 'Bracken, like ring fern, is a native to New Zealand. Pteridium esculentum is also found in Australia and the Society Islands but Pteridium aquilinum, a very close relative, is widespread throughout the world. Pteridium esculentum rapidly increased in area in New Zealand as early humans cleared and burned forests and it is now common throughout the country in open habitats. Bracken is a fern, reproducing by spores that germinate to produce a small prothallus This develops male and female sexual organs that in turn produce male and female gametes, resulting in the formation of a new fern plant. Bracken spores are very small and are released between late summer and autumn They can be carried for considerable distances on air currents. Bracken rhizomes were used by Maori as a starchy food, Dry bracken stalks have multiple uses as play things, from arrows to kite structures.', 'Tall-growing bracken can make stock access and mustering very difficult, Bracken, like ring fern, can form very dense cover, smothering useful pasture species, Bracken uses valuable soil nutrients for growth and these nutrients are locked up in the fronds until they eventually break down. Some strains of bracken appear to be more toxic than others, but all can be poisonous to livestock if large quantities are eaten, Bracken contains carcinogens that can cause cancerous lesions in livestock. Bracken competes strongly with young trees and is also a fire risk.', 'Bracken is rhizomatous and difficult to kill, Bracken commonly grows in poorer grazing land, therefore, its control may not be economically feasible. Grazing is not an effective method of control, but heavy treading by cattle can be used to crush the new fern shoots as they are emerging. Repeated mowing or crushing can be used as control measures. However, where bracken grows on steep hillsides this may not be practical. Establishment of new competitive pasture species, suited to local conditions, can be used after initial clearance of fern, and may, if adequately limed and fertilised, help to prevent reestablishment. Trees can form a dense canopy and shade out bracken but the trees must be protected from bracken when young. Bracken is generally very difficult to kill with herbicides, though it is susceptible to glyphosate and high rates of metsulfuron, both of which are damaging to grasses. Two selective herbicides – asulam and primisulfuron will control bracken within pine forests. Asulam should be applied without surfactant when releasing young trees. Asulam (Asulox) is selective in pastures and should be applied when bracken fronds are fully expanded but before they are affected by frost (late summer to early autumn). Its effect on the bracken will not be obvious until the following spring. No biological control agents are available for either species.');
